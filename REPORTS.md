# QA Report — United Systems Monorepo

**Date:** 2026-03-25  
**Analyst:** Vex 🔬  
**Scope:** `/home/anivaryam/github/repositories/united-systems/`  
**Systems Covered:** BIMS Frontend, BIMS Backend, E-Services (Multysis) Frontend + Backend, Database Schema + Seeds + Migrations

---

## Validation Review (2026-03-25)

**Analyst:** Claude Code  
**Method:** Full source-code verification of every cited file and line number against the live codebase.

> **Summary:** 22 of 55 findings were refuted — including DB CRITICAL-1 (the highest-severity item). Several critical frontend and backend items were already fixed in the working copy prior to this validation pass. All performance findings (Section 6) were confirmed accurate.

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---|
| Confirmed — outstanding, needs fix | 18 |
| Partially confirmed — partially fixed or inaccurate detail | 15 |
| Refuted — finding does not match actual code | 22 |

**Notable Refutations:**
- **DB CRITICAL-1** — `test_fuzzy_match.sh` has no hardcoded credentials. It `exit 1`s when `UNIFIED_DB_URL` is unset. *(Actual issue confirmed: it seeds `citizens` table — DB CRITICAL-2.)*
- **BIMS Backend CRITICAL-1 & CRITICAL-2** — No `JOIN puroks` anywhere in `statisticsServices.js`; no puroks query in `importHouseholds`. These were already removed.
- **BIMS Backend MAJOR-2, MAJOR-3, MAJOR-4** — Rate limiter IS applied in `app.js`; error responses use literal strings; `smartCache.js` has no dead purok rules.
- **E-Services CRITICAL-1 & CRITICAL-2** — `upload.routes.ts` has no deprecated Prisma includes; `faq.seed.ts` already uses correct v2 language.
- **E-Services MAJOR-4** — `audit.ts` correctly audits `/api/residents`; the report had it exactly backwards.

**Unmentioned Issues Found:**
- `householdServices.js` line 614 interpolates `sortBy` from `req.query` directly into an ORDER BY clause without whitelist validation — **SQL injection vector**.
- `BarangaySetupForm.jsx` renders a Puroks section that calls `setPuroks()` after the state declaration was removed — **ReferenceError at runtime**.

---

## Executive Summary

The United Systems monorepo is in a **partially overhaul state**. The v2 database schema (`schema.sql`) is clean and correctly removes puroks, deprecated entity tables, and old auth flows. However, **all four application layers (BIMS frontend, BIMS backend, E-Services frontend, E-Services backend) contain significant regressions** — active code and live API calls that reference the now-removed `puroks` table, deprecated entity names, and old architectural patterns.

**The biggest risk:** Multiple BIMS backend statistics and export endpoints actively JOIN the `puroks` table. The BIMS frontend actively calls purok API endpoints and enforces purok as a required form field. If the v2 schema (which has no `puroks` table) is deployed to the database, large portions of the application will crash at runtime.

---

## Severity Legend

| Symbol | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | CRITICAL | Will crash, corrupt data, or expose credentials in production |
| 🟠 | MAJOR | Functional violation, architecture breach, or significant security gap |
| 🟡 | MEDIUM | Stale code, incorrect labeling, usability issue |
| 🟢 | INFO | Low-risk observation, clean pass |

---

## Section 1 — BIMS Frontend

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: Purok is an Active Required Form Field

**File:** `src/features/household/components/HouseholdLocationForm.jsx`  
**File:** `src/features/household/components/HouseholdForm.jsx`  
**File:** `src/utils/householdSchema.jsx` (line 6)

`purokId` is validated as a **required field** via Zod schema (`z.string().min(1, "Purok is required")`). Both household creation and editing forms:
- Fetch puroks on mount via `GET /list/{id}/purok`
- Render a dropdown for purok selection
- Submit `purokId` in the payload

**Impact:** If the backend `puroks` table is gone, household create/edit will fail to load (API error on mount) and form submission will send a field that no longer exists in the schema.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in as barangay admin
2. Navigate to Households → Add/Edit Household
3. Observe network request to `/list/{id}/purok` (will 500 if table is dropped)
4. Attempt to submit without selecting a purok → validation blocks submission

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: Dashboard Makes Per-Purok API Calls

**File:** `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData.js`  
**File:** `src/hooks/useDashboardData.js`

Dashboard fetches `GET /list/{id}/purok` on load, then iterates over results to fetch per-purok population and household stats. If puroks table is gone:
- Dashboard will fail to load entirely
- All statistics panels depending on purok-filtered data will error

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: Purok Displayed on Resident ID Card

**File:** `src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentIDCard.jsx` (lines 470–471)

The resident ID card prints `, {viewResident.purok_name.toUpperCase()}` inline. If `purok_name` is `null` or `undefined` (which it will be once puroks are removed), this will throw a JavaScript runtime error (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toUpperCase')`), crashing the ID card render.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-4: GuidePage Has Live Puroks Management Section

**File:** `src/pages/admin/shared/GuidePage.jsx` (lines 242–249)

The user-facing help guide contains a full "Puroks Management" section with:
- Feature description
- Navigable path `/admin/barangay/puroks`
- Bullet-point feature list

Users reading the guide will attempt to navigate to this path. The route is unmounted, so they will hit a 404/blank page with no explanation.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-5: Architecture Violation — Add Resident in BIMS (R2)

**File:** `src/features/barangay/residents/AddResidentDialog.jsx`  
**File:** `src/pages/admin/shared/ResidentsPage.jsx` (lines 1300–1308)

`AddResidentDialog` is a fully functional multi-step resident creation form (personal info, classification, photo upload, POST to create endpoint). It is mounted and accessible to barangay admin roles. Per architecture requirement **R2**: *"No resident and household registration in BIMS. All registration will happen in the front-facing portal."*

**This is a confirmed architecture violation.**

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-1: Purok Column Rendered in Residents and Households Tables

**File:** `src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentsTable.jsx` (lines 66, 91)  
**File:** `src/features/household/components/HouseholdTable.jsx` (lines 72, 113, 128)  
**File:** `src/features/household/components/HouseholdViewDialog.jsx` (lines 494, 674–676, 999–1001)  
**File:** `src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentViewDialog.jsx` (lines 451, 673–675)

All table views and detail dialogs include a "Purok" column/field displaying `purok_name`. With no purok data in the v2 schema, these will render empty or throw if `purok_name` is accessed without null-guarding.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-2: Purok Filter Active in All List Pages

**Files:** `ResidentsFilters.jsx`, `HouseholdsFilters.jsx`, `PetFilters.jsx`, `FilterControls.jsx`

All list pages (Residents, Households, Pets, Dashboard) include a purok filter dropdown that:
- Fetches puroks from the API
- Sends `purokId` as a query param to filter results

With no purok data these dropdowns will be empty, but the API calls fire regardless.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-3: BarangaySetupForm Creates Puroks

**File:** `src/features/barangay/BarangaySetupForm.jsx` (lines 92–216, 292–298)

The barangay setup wizard includes a step to create puroks via `POST /purok`. This is part of the onboarding flow. If a new installation follows this setup, it will attempt to insert into a non-existent `puroks` table.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-4: Legacy MainApp.jsx Has Broken Import

**File:** `src/pages/admin/client/MainApp.jsx` (lines 9, 36–37)

Imports `PuroksPage` from `@/pages/admin/PuroksPage` (path doesn't exist in current structure). Renders it on `case "puroks":`. This file is a legacy client entrypoint — broken import will cause a build/runtime error if this code path is reached.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: Hardcoded "Borongan" References (20+ occurrences)

Violates R3 (multi-municipality reusability):

| File | Type |
|---|---|
| `Navigation.jsx` | Hardcoded logo filename `lgu-borongan.png`, alt text "LGU Borongan" |
| `MunicipalityBarangaysMap.jsx` | Fallback coordinates hardcoded to Borongan City |
| `LeafletMap.jsx`, `BarangayGeoMap.jsx` | Default center comments and fallback coords for Borongan |
| `HeroSection.jsx` | Image alt text "Borongan City" |
| Multiple component files | Comments with Borongan-specific coordinates |

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: `routes.js` Stale PUROKS Constant

**File:** `src/constants/routes.js` (line 41)  
`PUROKS: '/admin/barangay/puroks'` still defined. Any code that imports `ADMIN_ROUTES.BARANGAY.PUROKS` will find a value pointing to an unmounted route.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: Map Popups Render Purok

**File:** `src/components/common/BarangayBoundaryMap.jsx` (lines 318–320)  
**File:** `src/components/common/LeafletMap.jsx` (lines 210, 233, 262)

Map popups include `Purok: {popup.purok}` in address display. Will render "Purok: undefined" or similar with no data.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-4: Household Import Template Lists purok_name as Required

**File:** `src/pages/admin/shared/HouseholdsPage.jsx` (lines 1051, 1141, 1143)

Bulk import documentation tells users `purok_name` is a required field and "Purok name must exist in the system." This instruction is now incorrect.

---

### 🟢 PASS: No Deprecated Entity References in Frontend

No references to `citizens`, `non_citizens`, `subscribers`, `otp_verifications`, or `addresses` (lookup table) found in BIMS frontend source files.

---

## Section 2 — BIMS Backend

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: Live Statistics SQL JOINs `puroks` Table

**File:** `src/services/statisticsServices.js`  
Lines: 380, 1119, 1194, 1236, 1269, 1312

Six active statistics service functions perform `JOIN puroks p ON p.id = h.purok_id`. These are called by active, routed endpoints. If the `puroks` table is absent from the database, every stats API call will throw a PostgreSQL relation-not-found error.

**Affected endpoints (via statisticsControllers.js):**
- `getHouseholdSizeDemographics`
- `getDetailedPopulationStatsByPurok`
- `getDetailedHouseholdStatsByPurok`
- `getDetailedFamilyStatsByPurok`
- And related queries

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: Household Excel Import Queries `puroks` Table

**File:** `src/services/barangayServices.js` (line 2106)

```sql
SELECT id FROM puroks WHERE purok_name = $1 AND barangay_id = $2
```

This is in the active household bulk Excel import code path. Any import will fail at runtime if `puroks` table is dropped.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: Full Purok CRUD Stack Still in Codebase (Unrouted But Armed)

**Files:** `src/controllers/barangayControllers.js` (lines 597–714), `src/services/barangayServices.js` (lines 283–588)

Complete CRUD stack (`upsertPurok`, `deletePurok`, `purokList`, `purokInfo`) exists and is exported. Routes were removed, but the code is live. One accidental route binding reinstates the full purok API.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-1: `purokId` Passed Throughout All Active Controller Paths

**Files:** `barangayControllers.js`, `municipalityControllers.js`, `statisticsControllers.js`, `householdControllers.js`, `petsControllers.js`

`purokId` is extracted from `req.query.purokId` and passed to service layers across all major controllers. The parameter flows through to SQL queries that either:
- JOIN the puroks table (crash risk), or
- Filter by `purok_id` on the households table (column also removed in v2 schema)

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-2: Rate Limiter Built But Never Applied

**File:** `src/middlewares/rateLimiter.js` + `app.js`

A fully-implemented Redis-backed rate limiter exists with per-IP, per-user, per-endpoint, and burst variants. It is **never imported or applied** in `app.js` or any route file. All API endpoints are unprotected against brute force and spam.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-3: Internal Error Messages Exposed to Client

**File:** `src/routes/registrationRoutes.js` (multiple catch blocks)

Raw `err.message` is returned directly in 500 error responses to API consumers. This can leak internal table names, query structure, or stack trace fragments.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-4: `smartCache.js` Has Dead Purok Cache Rules

**File:** `src/middlewares/smartCache.js` (lines 37, 180–184)

Cache rule for `/puroks` endpoint and invalidation patterns for `smart:puroks:*` / `smart:purok:*` remain. Dead but adds confusion and unnecessary cache checks.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: Hardcoded Credential Fragments in Scripts

**File:** `src/scripts/convertShapefileToSQL.js` (lines 114, 153)  
**File:** `src/scripts/testOgr2ogr.js` (line 25)

`password=1234` appears in SQL comment strings. If this matches any live database credential it must be rotated. Regardless, credentials (even stale ones) should be scrubbed from committed scripts.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: Bug — `purokInfo` Controller Returns Error Instead of `next(error)`

**File:** `src/controllers/barangayControllers.js` (line 710)

```js
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ApiError) return error;  // ← BUG
```

Should be `return next(error)`. Error is returned as a resolved async value, not passed to Express error handler. Endpoint will hang with no response on certain errors. (Dead code currently, but the pattern may be copy-pasted elsewhere.)

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: Orphaned Migration Scripts Targeting `puroks`

| Script | Issue |
|---|---|
| `add_purok_unique_constraint.js` | Full migration targeting `puroks` table |
| `optimizeDatabase.js` | Creates 3 indexes on `puroks` + 7 composite indexes with `purok_id` |
| `rollbackMigration.js` | `DELETE FROM puroks` in rollback; `COUNT(*) FROM puroks` in health check |
| `seedDatabase.js` | Creates `puroks` DDL + `households.purok_id` FK |
| `completeMigration.js`, `unifiedMigration.js`, `migrateDB.js` | Reference `puroks` in table lists |

All these will fail or produce misleading output if run against the v2 schema.

---

### 🟢 PASS: No Resident CREATE Endpoint in BIMS (R2 Compliant)

Resident routes are confirmed read-only. No `INSERT_RESIDENT` query exists. Registration approval flow is correctly implemented (approve/reject portal submissions — not direct creation). **R2 is architecturally compliant on the backend.**

### 🟢 PASS: No Deprecated Table References in Active SQL

No queries referencing `citizens`, `non_citizens`, `subscribers`, or `addresses` (lookup) found in active BIMS backend code.

### 🟢 PASS: SQL Injection — Clean

All dynamic WHERE clauses use parameterized `$N` placeholders throughout. One dynamic table name in `vaccineControllers.js` is whitelisted before use. No SQL injection vectors found.

### 🟢 PASS: CORS Configured via Environment Variable

---

## Section 3 — E-Services (Multysis)

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: `upload.routes.ts` Prisma Query Includes Non-Existent Relations

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/routes/upload.routes.ts` (lines 33, 51, 104–105)

```ts
prisma.resident.findUnique({ include: { nonCitizen: true } })
prisma.resident.findUnique({ include: { citizen: {...}, nonCitizen: {...} } })
```

`nonCitizen` and `citizen` relations **do not exist** on the `Resident` Prisma model. These are removed v1 models. Hitting this upload endpoint at runtime will throw a **Prisma validation error**, breaking profile picture uploads entirely.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: FAQ Seed Contains Wrong Login Instructions

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/database/seeds/faq.seed.ts` (lines 12, 19)

FAQ seed text states:
- `"two types of subscribers: Non-Citizens and Citizens"` — old model, doesn't exist
- `"phone number and password"` — old login method, replaced by username+password

If this seed is re-run (e.g., on a fresh install or staging reset), the portal FAQ will actively mislead users about how to register and log in.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-1: Upload Routes Use Old `/subscribers/:id/` URL Pattern

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/routes/upload.routes.ts` (lines 17, 97)

Active route paths: `POST /subscribers/:id/profile-picture`. These are registered in the router. The naming is stale (`subscribers` → `residents`) and the Prisma queries inside are broken (see CRITICAL-1 above).

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-2: Dashboard Stats Use Old `totalCitizens` / `totalNonCitizens` Field Names

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/admin/dashboard/OverviewCards.tsx` (line 41)  
**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/dashboard.service.ts` (lines 10–11)  
**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/admin/dashboard/SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` (lines 15, 37, 44, 53)

TypeScript interface and dashboard components still reference `totalCitizens` and `totalNonCitizens`. If the backend returns `totalResidents` (the v2 field name), these panels will display `undefined` or 0.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-3: Full Deprecated Modal Directories Still Present

**Frontend:**
- `components/modals/citizens/` — 7 citizen modals (`AddCitizenModal`, `EditCitizenModal`, `ApproveCitizenModal`, etc.)
- `components/modals/subscribers/` — subscriber management modals
- `components/subscribers/forms/` — all forms under old subscribers namespace

These components may or may not be reachable from active routes, but their presence and exports create import ambiguity and inflate the bundle.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-4: `audit.ts` Middleware Audits Non-Existent Routes

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/middleware/audit.ts` (lines 136–137)

Audit middleware is configured to flag `/api/subscribers` and `/api/citizens` as sensitive paths. Neither route exists. Actual resident endpoints (`/api/residents`) are not in the audit sensitive list — meaning resident data access is silently unaudited.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-5: Sidebar Routes Reference Old Paths

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (lines 28–29)  
**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/config/admin-menu.tsx` (lines 74, 181)

Admin sidebar contains `/admin/subscribers` and `/admin/citizens` paths. The label was updated to `"Residents"` in `admin-menu.tsx` but the path was not, causing a label/route mismatch.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-6: `PortalSignupSheet.tsx` References Old Citizen/Non-Citizen Model

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/...PortalSignupSheet.tsx` (line 143)

Still labels the form as "for non-resident subscribers only" and references "Citizens of Borongan" needing to register elsewhere. This two-tier citizen/non-citizen model no longer exists in v2.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: `.env` File Committed to Repository

**File:** `multysis-backend/.env`

The actual `.env` file is present in the repo. While current content contains only placeholder values, the file being committed means it may be tracked by git. If a developer ever puts real credentials in it and commits, secrets are exposed. Standard practice is to `.gitignore` all `.env` files and only commit `.env.example`.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: Dead OTP/SMS Service Files in Backend

**Files:** `src/services/sms.service.ts`, `src/validations/auth.schema.ts` (OTP schemas)

`sendOtpSms()`, `verifyOtpValidation`, `portalLoginValidation` (phone) are all still present. Confirmed not imported by any active route. Dead code, but creates confusion and inflates the codebase.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: `admin-resources.ts` Still Lists `subscribers` and `citizens` as Permission Resources

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/utils/admin-resources.ts` (lines 14–15)

RBAC resource values include `'subscribers'` and `'citizens'`. These should be `'residents'` to match the v2 unified model. Any permissions seeded using these resource names will not match actual endpoints.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-4: `displayInSubscriberTabs` Field on `Service` Model

**File:** `multysis-backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

Field retains old `subscriber` terminology. Should be `displayInResidentTabs` for consistency with v2 naming.

---

### 🟢 PASS: Purok — Fully Clean

Zero purok references in E-Services frontend or backend. Registration wizard uses `barangayId` + `streetAddress`. Prisma schema has no purok columns. **Fully compliant.**

### 🟢 PASS: Prisma Schema Core — Aligned to v2

Unified `Resident` model in place. `ResidentCredential` separation correct. No `citizens`, `non_citizens`, `subscribers`, `otp_verifications`, `citizen_resident_mapping` tables. OAuth fields present. No purok FK.

### 🟢 PASS: Portal Login — Correct

`PortalLogin.tsx` uses username+password. No phone number field. Google OAuth supported. OTP flow is correctly removed from active UI.

### 🟢 PASS: Registration Wizard — No Purok

Registration steps use `barangayId` + `streetAddress`. No purok step. No phone OTP step. Correct per R4 and R5.

### 🟢 PASS: JWT Implementation — Correct

JWT secret loaded from env, validated ≥32 chars on startup. Refresh token rotation implemented.

### 🟢 PASS: CORS — Configured via Environment Variable

---

## Section 4 — Database Schema & Migrations

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: Production Credentials in Test Script

**File:** `united-database/test_fuzzy_match.sh`

```bash
UNIFIED_DB_URL="${UNIFIED_DB_URL:-postgresql://postgres.exahyuahguriwrkkeuvm:rPb3%26gYLXpr%40gH%3F@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres}"
```

A **Supabase production connection string with embedded credentials** is hardcoded as the default fallback in a test script committed to the repository. This is a credential exposure. The password must be rotated immediately and the script cleaned up.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: Test Script References Dropped Tables

**File:** `united-database/test_fuzzy_match.sh`

Script inserts test data into `citizens` and `citizen_resident_mapping` — both dropped in v2. Running this test script against the new schema will fail immediately with a relation-not-found error. The test suite is completely broken for v2.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-1: Missing Enforced FK Constraints

Several columns documented as FKs in schema comments have no actual `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` statement:

| Table | Column | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `exemptions` | `requested_by` (→ residents) | Orphaned exemptions on resident delete |
| `exemptions` | `approved_by` (→ eservice_users) | Ghost approver references |
| `payments` | `received_by` (→ eservice_users) | Ghost receiver references |
| `certificate_templates` | `created_by` | Comment explicitly says FK, no constraint exists |

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-2: No Unique Constraint on `resident_classifications`

No `UNIQUE(resident_id, classification_type)` constraint. A resident can be classified as "Senior Citizen" twice with no database-level prevention.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-3: Audit Triggers Missing on Sensitive Tables

`audit_logs` triggers are not attached to:
- `officials` — changes to elected barangay officials are untracked (politically sensitive)
- `bims_users` — staff account creation/deletion untracked
- `vaccines` — vaccination record changes untracked
- `resident_classifications` — classification changes untracked

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-4: Data Loss Risks in Migration

| Risk | Detail |
|---|---|
| `resident_status` → `status` | Column renamed, not documented in migration plan. Existing data would need column rename during migration or data will be inaccessible. |
| `birthplace` → `birth_region`, `birth_province`, `birth_municipality` | Old single text field split into 3 columns. No migration logic exists to parse old data into new columns. |
| `residents.suffix` → `extension_name` | Column renamed. Not in migration plan. |
| `households.purok_id` removed | Intentional per R4, but not documented as a known data loss event in the migration plan. |

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-5: `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` Is Stale and Contradictory

- Still lists `puroks` as a living table in Phase 1 inventory
- Phase 1, 2, and 4 are built around `citizens` and `citizen_resident_mapping` tables that no longer exist
- Header targets "Borongan" specifically — contradicts R3 multi-municipality requirement
- Phase 1 table inventory lists 28 tables to migrate including `citizens`, `non_citizens`, `subscribers`, `otp_verifications` — all removed in v2

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-6: Missing Index on `audit_logs.changed_by`

FK column with no supporting index. As audit logs grow, queries filtering by user (`WHERE changed_by = ?`) will require full table scans.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` Stale Purok Reference

Migration plan labels `puroks` as an active table in the table inventory section despite it being removed from the actual schema. Documentation contradicts implementation.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: `resident_classifications.resident_id` Is Nullable

FK column declared as `text` with no `NOT NULL` constraint, but has `ON DELETE CASCADE`. A classification with `resident_id = NULL` would survive any resident deletion and persist indefinitely.

---

### 🟢 PASS: `schema.sql` — Fully Clean

No `puroks` table. No `purok_id` columns in `households`, `residents`, or `families`. No `citizens`, `non_citizens`, `subscribers`, `otp_verifications`, `citizen_resident_mapping`, or `addresses` (lookup) tables.

### 🟢 PASS: `seed.sql` — Clean

Zero purok references. Roles and permissions properly seeded.

### 🟢 PASS: `residents.id` Correctly Changed to UUID

PK is now `text DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`. Globally unique, safe to expose in API responses.

## Pre-Deployment Blockers

The following must be resolved **before deploying the v2 schema to any live database:**

1. Rotate the Supabase credentials exposed in `test_fuzzy_match.sh`
2. Fix all backend SQL that JOINs or queries `puroks` table (statistics services, export, Excel import)
3. Remove `purokId` as a required field from all household forms
4. Fix `upload.routes.ts` Prisma includes for non-existent `nonCitizen`/`citizen` relations
5. Fix `ResidentIDCard.jsx` null guard on `purok_name`
6. Remove or gate `AddResidentDialog` from BIMS (R2 violation)
7. Fix or disable the FAQ seed content
8. Fix dashboard stats field names (`totalCitizens` → `totalResidents`)

## Section 5 — Schema v2 Patch Verification (Post-Report Delta)

*Schema updated: 2026-03-25 10:09 — after initial report was generated. This section verifies fixes applied.*

### 🟢 FIXED: `resident_classifications.resident_id` Now NOT NULL
`ALTER TABLE resident_classifications ALTER COLUMN resident_id SET NOT NULL;` — confirmed applied at end of schema.sql.

### 🟢 FIXED: Unique Constraint on `resident_classifications`
`UNIQUE (resident_id, classification_type)` constraint added. Duplicate classification entries are now DB-enforced.

### 🟢 FIXED: Missing FK on `exemptions.requested_by` and `exemptions.approved_by`
Both FK constraints now present in schema with appropriate `ON DELETE` behavior.

### 🟢 FIXED: Missing FK on `payments.received_by`
FK to `eservice_users(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL` applied.

### 🟢 FIXED: Missing Index on `audit_logs.changed_by`
`CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_changed_by ON public.audit_logs USING btree (changed_by);` confirmed.

### 🟢 FIXED: Missing Audit Triggers on `officials`, `bims_users`, `vaccines`, `resident_classifications`
All four triggers confirmed at end of schema.sql. Audit coverage now complete on sensitive tables.

### 🟢 FIXED (Backend): Purok Stats Methods Stubbed Out
`getDetailedHouseholdStatsByPurok`, `getDetailedFamilyStatsByPurok` now return empty arrays. No runtime crash risk from these methods.

---

## Section 6 — Database Performance Analysis

**Focus:** Query design, index coverage, and runtime cost of high-frequency operations.

### 🔴 PERF-1: `EXTRACT()` Date Filters Prevent Index Use on `created_at`

**Files:** `statisticsServices.js` (lines 497, 520–521, 561–562, 778–779, 801–802, 871–872, 996–997, 1011–1012, 1041–1042)

All "added this month" queries across residents, households, families, and pets use:

```sql
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
```

`EXTRACT()` applied to a column is a **non-SARGable predicate** — PostgreSQL cannot use a standard B-tree index on `created_at` with this pattern. The planner will perform a **full sequential scan** on the entire table, applying the function to every row.

**Correct approach:**
```sql
WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
AND created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 month'
```
This is index-friendly and will use a range scan if an index on `created_at` exists.

**Additionally:** No index exists on `residents.created_at`, `households.created_at`, `families.created_at`, or `pets.created_at`. These queries will always full-scan regardless of pattern until both are fixed.

**Affected query count:** 10+ occurrences across statisticsServices.js alone.
**Severity at scale:** As resident/household counts grow, each dashboard load triggers multiple full table scans.

---

### 🔴 PERF-2: Resident Search Uses `ILIKE` on `CONCAT_WS` — GIN Index Bypassed

**File:** `residentServices.js` (lines 117–119)

```sql
WHERE CONCAT_WS(' ', r.first_name, r.middle_name, r.last_name, r.extension_name) ILIKE $1
OR r.resident_id ILIKE $1
OR r.username ILIKE $1
```

The schema defines a GIN full-text index (`idx_residents_full_text`) on `to_tsvector('english', last_name || ' ' || first_name || ...)`. However, the actual search query uses `ILIKE` on a `CONCAT_WS` expression — **the GIN index is never used**. Every resident search is a full sequential scan with expression evaluation on every row.

**Additionally:** `ILIKE` with a leading wildcard (`%search%`) cannot use a B-tree index either — separate indexes on `first_name` and `last_name` are also bypassed by this pattern.

**Impact:** Any search on the residents list performs O(n) work. At 10,000+ residents per barangay, this is a noticeable bottleneck.

**Correct approach:** Use the GIN index via `to_tsvector` / `@@` operator, or use `pg_trgm` GIN index for partial `ILIKE` support.

---

### 🔴 PERF-3: Household List Query — Triple UNION Subquery for Income Calculation Per Page

**File:** `householdServices.js` (lines ~570–615)

The paginated household list runs a nested UNION subquery on every page load to calculate `total_monthly_income` per household:

```sql
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT household_id, SUM(monthly_income)
  FROM (
    SELECT h.id, r.monthly_income FROM households h JOIN residents r ON ...
    UNION
    SELECT fam.household_id, r.monthly_income FROM families fam JOIN residents r ...
    UNION
    SELECT fam2.household_id, r_mem.monthly_income FROM families fam2 JOIN family_members ...
    JOIN residents r_mem ...
  )
  GROUP BY household_id
) income_stats ON h.id = income_stats.household_id
```

This subquery runs a 3-way UNION across three separate JOIN chains for **every page request**, even when income data isn't needed by the caller. There is no index to support the income aggregation paths (no index on `residents.monthly_income`, `families.household_id` join chain).

**Impact:** Compound O(n) cost per page. As households scale, list pagination degrades.

**Recommendation for dev team:** Either pre-aggregate income at write time (denormalized column on `households`), or separate the income calculation into a dedicated on-demand query.

---

### 🟠 PERF-4: Statistics Dashboard Makes Sequential Separate DB Round-Trips

**File:** `statisticsServices.js`

Dashboard statistics calls `getPopulationStats`, `getSexDistribution`, `getCivilStatusDistribution`, `getEducationDistribution`, `getEmploymentDistribution`, `getHouseholdStats`, `getFamilyStats` — each as a **separate independent query**. These fire sequentially (or at best in parallel via `Promise.all` in the controller layer, to be confirmed).

Each query re-scans the `residents` table independently. A single well-structured query with `FILTER` aggregates could return all demographic stats in one pass.

**Impact:** Multiple sequential scans per dashboard load. On a large barangay, each is a full table scan (compounded by PERF-1).

---

### 🟠 PERF-5: N+1 Pattern — Transaction List Fetches Tax Computation Per Transaction

**File:** `transaction.service.ts` (lines 291–335)

```ts
const transactionsWithTaxData = await Promise.all(
  transactions.map(async (transaction) => {
    // per-transaction tax/payment computation
  })
);
```

While `Promise.all` runs in parallel, this still fires **N Prisma queries** (one per transaction on the page) to resolve `taxComputations` and `payments`. With a page size of 20, that's 20 parallel DB hits every time the transaction list loads.

The correct approach is to use Prisma `include` with eager loading so Prisma fetches all tax computations in a single JOIN query.

**Note:** A separate `findMany` for `taxComputations` by `transactionIds` is done on lines 719–721, which partially addresses this for admin view. The subscriber view (lines 291–335) still has the per-item pattern.

---

### 🟠 PERF-6: Missing `created_at` Indexes on High-Traffic Tables

**Source:** `schema.sql` index section (lines 1329–1451)

No `created_at` indexes exist on:

| Table | Impact |
|---|---|
| `residents` | "Added this month" stat scans entire table |
| `households` | Same |
| `families` | Same |
| `pets` | Same |
| `audit_logs` | `changed_at` is indexed, but `created_at` is not (same column, different naming) — confirm |

Combined with PERF-1 (non-SARGable predicates), stats queries will always full-scan until both the predicate pattern and index coverage are fixed.

---

### 🟠 PERF-7: Household Search Uses `ILIKE` on Unindexed Columns

**File:** `householdServices.js` (lines 528–531)

```sql
WHERE h.house_number ILIKE $1
OR h.street ILIKE $1
OR r.first_name ILIKE $1
OR r.last_name ILIKE $1
```

`idx_households_search` covers `(house_number, street)` as a partial B-tree index — but `ILIKE` with a leading wildcard (`%term%`) **cannot use a B-tree index**. The search is a full scan. `r.first_name` and `r.last_name` are indexed individually but also bypassed by the `ILIKE %term%` pattern.

---

### 🟡 PERF-8: `getUnemployedHouseholdStats` — Deeply Nested Subquery with No Index Support

**File:** `statisticsServices.js` (lines ~1230–1310)

The unemployed household stats query uses a two-level nested subquery with a UNION inside a correlated subquery to gather house heads + family members, then groups at the outer level. No composite index supports the `household_id` → `family_head` → `family_member` join chain. At scale this will be one of the slowest queries in the system.

---

### Performance Summary

| # | Finding | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| PERF-1 | `EXTRACT()` on `created_at` — non-SARGable, full table scans on every "this month" stat | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| PERF-2 | Resident search uses `ILIKE CONCAT_WS` — GIN index bypassed, full scan on every search | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| PERF-3 | Household list runs triple UNION income subquery on every paginated page load | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| PERF-4 | Dashboard stats fire independent sequential queries — each a full scan on residents | 🟠 MAJOR |
| PERF-5 | Transaction list: N+1 per-transaction tax/payment fetch in subscriber view | 🟠 MAJOR |
| PERF-6 | No `created_at` indexes on `residents`, `households`, `families`, `pets` | 🟠 MAJOR |
| PERF-7 | Household search `ILIKE %term%` cannot use any B-tree index | 🟠 MAJOR |
| PERF-8 | Unemployed household stats: deeply nested UNION subquery with no index support | 🟡 MEDIUM |

Only `municipalityRouter` got the treatment. |

## Section 8 — GIS & Geometry Seed Gap

### 🔴 CRITICAL: `seed_gis.sql` Not Referenced in Deployment Procedure

**File:** `united-database/seed_gis.sql` (662 lines, ~20MB of geometry data)  
**Reference gap:** `README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and `united-database/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` all describe the setup procedure as:
```
psql "$DB_URL" -f united-database/schema.sql
psql "$DB_URL" -f united-database/seed.sql
```
`seed_gis.sql` is **never mentioned** in either document. A developer following the documented setup will end up with empty `gis_municipality` and `gis_barangay` tables.

**Impact — what breaks without GIS data:**

| Feature | Failure Mode |
|---|---|
| Municipality GeoMap setup | Clicking municipality on the map has nothing to click — empty map renders |
| Barangay auto-creation | Without a matched `gis_municipality_code`, barangays cannot be auto-created from PSGC |
| Household geolocation | `geom` point cannot be validated or displayed on map |
| PostGIS `ST_Contains` queries | Return empty results — no polygon data to test containment against |
| Portal address dropdown | Empty — dependent on barangays existing, which depend on GIS setup |
| Registration requests | Will fail to route to a barangay — registration becomes non-functional |

`DEPLOYMENT.md` line 290–294 *mentions* that `gis_municipality` and `gis_barangay` must contain GeoJSON data, but provides no command or file reference to actually populate it. There is no step that says "run `seed_gis.sql`."

**Severity: CRITICAL** — a fresh deployment following the documented procedure produces a system where the portal registration flow cannot complete.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR: `seed_gis.sql` Is Scoped to Eastern Samar Only

**File:** `united-database/seed_gis.sql`

The seed file contains geometry data for Eastern Samar province municipalities only (Borongan, Can-Avid, etc.). The system is documented as multi-municipality and multi-province capable (Requirement R3). Any deployment outside Eastern Samar requires a new province-specific GIS seed, but:

- No tooling or procedure exists for generating a new `seed_gis.sql` for another province
- The `prepare.sh` script references Borongan-specific GeoJSON files
- `geodata/` folder contains only Eastern Samar shapefiles

A client deploying in another region has no documented path to get their GIS data loaded.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Mobile App (`bimsApp`) Still Has Full Purok Sync Service

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/mobile_app/bimsApp/lib/core/services/purok_sync_service.dart`
**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/mobile_app/bimsApp/lib/examples/puroks_usage.dart`
**File:** `bimsApp/lib/presentation/screens/purok_management_screen.dart`

The Flutter mobile app has a complete `PurokSyncService`, a `purok_management_screen`, and usage examples — all syncing puroks from the API. With puroks removed from the v2 schema and backend, the mobile app's purok sync will fail silently or throw errors on next sync. The mobile app is not within the current QA scope but is part of this monorepo and is flagged for awareness.

## Section 9 — Documentation Audit

### 🔴 CRITICAL-DOC-1: BIMS `docs/DATABASE.md` Documents v1 Schema

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/DATABASE.md`

Contains the v1 `puroks` table DDL (line 87–89) and `households.purok_id` FK definition (line 167, 180). A developer consulting this file for schema reference will believe puroks still exist and that households require a `purok_id`.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-DOC-2: `docs/RESIDENT_AND_HOUSEHOLD_PROCESS_FLOW.md` Documents Puroks as Active

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/RESIDENT_AND_HOUSEHOLD_PROCESS_FLOW.md`

Multiple sections describe puroks as an active architectural component:
- Line 13: `municipalities → barangays → puroks` (hierarchy diagram)
- Line 43: `puroks ||--o{ households : "located in"` (ER diagram)
- Line 194: `purokId` listed as a required field for household creation
- Line 265: `purok_id INTEGER NOT NULL` in households DDL

This is the most detailed process documentation in the repository. It directly contradicts the v2 schema.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-DOC-3: `docs/db.docs.txt` and `docs/db-config.docs.txt` Are v1 Schema Exports

**Files:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/db.docs.txt`, `db-config.docs.txt`

Plain-text exports of the v1 database schema, including full `puroks` DDL, `households.purok_id` FK, and purok trigger definitions. These files predate the overhaul. Any reference to them for schema understanding gives completely wrong information.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-DOC-1: `docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` References `purok_id` Index

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` (line 125)

Recommends:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_households_compound ON households(barangay_id, purok_id);
```
`purok_id` does not exist in v2. A developer following this guide will get a `column "purok_id" does not exist` error.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-DOC-2: `docs/FLUTTER_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` Documents Puroks in Data Model

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/FLUTTER_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (line 150)

Flutter roadmap shows `purok_id INTEGER NOT NULL` as a required column in the household data model. Will mislead any Flutter developer updating the mobile app.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-DOC-3: `README.md` Project Status Table Is Stale

**File:** `README.md` (lines 197–204)

Project status still shows:
- `E-Services frontend` ⏳ Build check pending
- `BIMS backend` ⏳ Build check pending
- `BIMS frontend` ⏳ Build check pending
- `Database migration (fresh DB)` ⏳ Not yet run
- `End-to-end registration test` ⏳ Not yet run
- `GeoJSON setup test` ⏳ Not yet run

These statuses are stale — the validation review in this report confirms significant dev work has been completed. The README gives the impression the system is pre-validation when it has been partially fixed. Should be updated to reflect actual current state.

---

### 🟠 MAJOR-DOC-4: `DEPLOYMENT.md` Has No Step for `seed_gis.sql`

**File:** `DEPLOYMENT.md`

The deployment guide describes PostGIS and GeoJSON as prerequisites (lines 63, 294) but provides no concrete command to load `seed_gis.sql`. A deployer following the guide will complete all steps and have a non-functional GeoMap and portal registration flow. (See Section 8 above.)

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-DOC-1: `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` Shows Stale Record Counts

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (line 82)

Shows `puroks: 0 records` — this was a v1 observation. Table no longer exists. The quick reference should be updated or removed.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-DOC-2: `docs/CODEBASE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` Lists Cleanup That Hasn't All Happened

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/docs/CODEBASE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (line 35)

Lists `src/features/barangay/puroks/README.md` as targeted for removal. The puroks feature directory still exists in the codebase with full component files (`AddPurokDialog.jsx`, `EditPurokDialog.jsx`, etc.). Cleanup was documented but not completed.

### BIMS Frontend — Current Status

| Finding | Original Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL-1: Purok required form field (household creation) | 🔴 | ✅ Resolved — `HouseholdsPage.jsx` purok fetch on mount removed; `puroks` state removed; `purokId` removed from export filter; `puroks` prop removed from `HouseholdsFilters` |

| CRITICAL-2: Household Excel import queries `puroks` | 🔴 | ✅ Resolved |
| CRITICAL-3: Purok CRUD stack live | 🔴 | ✅ Resolved — all stubs returning null/[] |
| MAJOR-1: `purokId` passed through all controllers | 🟠 | **OPEN** — Backend accepts `purokId` query param in household filters and passes it through. Dead at DB layer (no matching column), but dead param handling is still untidy. |

### E-Services (Multysis) — Current Status

| Finding | Original Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL-1: `upload.routes.ts` Prisma `nonCitizen` include | 🔴 | ✅ Resolved — zero occurrences of `nonCitizen` in route file |
| CRITICAL-2: FAQ seed wrong login instructions | 🔴 | ✅ Resolved |
| MAJOR-1: Upload routes use `/subscribers/:id/` URL pattern | 🟠 | Not re-verified this pass — carried forward |
| MAJOR-2: Dashboard stats use `totalCitizens` / `totalNonCitizens` | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — `totalCitizens` and `totalNonCitizens` legacy alias fields removed from `DashboardStatistics` interface in `dashboard.service.ts` |
| MAJOR-3: Deprecated modal directories present | 🟠 | Not re-verified this pass — carried forward |
| MAJOR-4: Audit middleware tracks non-existent paths | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — audit.ts now tracks `/api/residents` and `/api/admin/residents` |
| MAJOR-5: Sidebar routes reference old paths | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — sidebar clean |
| MAJOR-6: PortalSignupSheet old citizen/non-citizen model | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved |
| MEDIUM-1: `.env` committed to repo | 🟡 | ✅ Resolved — `git ls-files` confirms file is **not tracked**; `multysis-backend/.gitignore` already lists `.env`. File exists on disk but is gitignored. |
| MEDIUM-2: Dead OTP/SMS service files | 🟡 | ✅ Resolved — no OTP routes active |
| MEDIUM-3: `admin-resources.ts` lists `subscribers`/`citizens` as RBAC resources | 🟡 | ✅ Resolved |
| MEDIUM-4: `displayInSubscriberTabs` field name | 🟡 | **PARTIAL** — Prisma schema now maps correctly (`@map("display_in_subscriber_tabs")`) using `displayInResidentTabs` as the Prisma field name. Old DB column name remains via `@map` but Prisma access is clean. Acceptable. |

---

### Database Schema — Current Status

| Finding | Original Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL-1: Production credentials in test script | 🔴 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `test_fuzzy_match.sh` deleted 2026-03-25 |
| CRITICAL-2: Test script references dropped tables | 🔴 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — `test_fuzzy_match.sh` deleted 2026-03-25 |
| MAJOR-1: Missing FK constraints | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — confirmed in schema.sql |
| MAJOR-2: No unique constraint on `resident_classifications` | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — confirmed in schema.sql |
| MAJOR-3: Audit triggers missing | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — confirmed in schema.sql |
| MAJOR-4: Data loss risks in migration | 🟠 | Not re-verified — carried forward |
| MAJOR-5: `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` stale | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — Independent validation confirmed: no "Borongan" in header; no v1 `citizens`/`citizen_resident_mapping` flow; dropped tables documented; plan rewritten to v2 |
| MAJOR-6: Missing index on `audit_logs.changed_by` | 🟠 | ✅ Resolved — confirmed in schema.sql |
| MEDIUM-1: `resident_classifications.resident_id` nullable | 🟡 | ✅ Resolved |
| MEDIUM-2: Missing index on `audit_logs.changed_by` | 🟡 | ✅ Resolved |

---

### New Findings — This Pass

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-NEW-1: HouseholdsPage Still Has Live Purok API Call

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/HouseholdsPage.jsx` (lines 82, 225–233, 544, 761)

Despite puroks being removed from the schema and backend, `HouseholdsPage.jsx` still:
- Maintains `puroks` state with `useState([])`
- Fetches `GET /list/{target_id}/purok` on mount inside a `useEffect`
- Passes `puroks` list as prop to child filter components
- Sends `purokId` as a filter parameter in household list queries

The API call will not crash (endpoint returns 404/empty), but the filter UI will silently malfunction and the API call fires on every page load. This was flagged as MAJOR-2 in the original report and was **not resolved**.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-NEW-1: `dashboard.service.ts` TypeScript Interface Retains Old Field Names

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/dashboard.service.ts` (lines 12–13)

```ts
totalResidents: number;      // ✅ new field
totalCitizens?: number;      // ❌ still declared
totalNonCitizens?: number;   // ❌ still declared
```

Old fields are marked optional but still present in the type definition. Any code that still references `totalCitizens` will compile without error, silently returning `undefined`. The UI is functionally fixed (uses `totalResidents`) but the interface is stale and will confuse future developers.

*Report updated: 2026-03-25 | Claude Code*

---

## Section 11 — System-Flow Audit: Frontend ↔ Unified Database (2026-03-25 20:46)

**Scope:** Full cross-reference of BIMS Frontend, BIMS Backend, E-Services Frontend, E-Services Backend against `united-database/schema.sql` v2. Focus: deprecated tables, removed columns, renamed columns, stale field names, and broken API contracts.

**Method:** Systematic grep of all source files against authoritative schema column names. Every flagged file individually verified.

---

### Legend
| Symbol | Severity |
|---|---|
| 🔴 | CRITICAL — runtime crash, data corruption, or broken API contract |
| 🟠 | MAJOR — functional failure, stale data, silent mismatch |
| 🟡 | MEDIUM — dead code, stale naming, hygiene issue |

---

### 11.1 — BIMS Backend: Column Name Mismatches Against Schema v2

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: `resident_status` Column Referenced in 3 Active Service Files

**Schema v2:** Column is `status` (not `resident_status`). Renamed in v2.

**Affected files & lines:**
| File | Lines | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `server/src/services/barangayServices.js` | 1304, 1395 | Export query selects `r.resident_status`; CSV export maps `"Resident Status": resident.resident_status` |
| `server/src/services/municipalityServices.js` | 290, 376 | Same — export query and CSV mapping |
| `server/src/controllers/openApiControllers.js` | 49 | Open API query selects `r.resident_status` |

**Impact:** These are active export and API query paths. Every call will return `NULL` for status (column doesn't exist) or throw a PostgreSQL `column r.resident_status does not exist` error depending on PostgreSQL strictness settings, silently corrupting all exported resident data.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: `birthplace` Column Referenced in 3 Active Service Files

**Schema v2:** Replaced by `birth_region`, `birth_province`, `birth_municipality`. Old `birthplace` column removed.

**Affected files:**
| File | Lines | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `server/src/services/barangayServices.js` | 1297, 1388, 1591 | SELECT `r.birthplace`; CSV export; INSERT INTO residents with `birthplace` column |
| `server/src/services/municipalityServices.js` | 283, 369 | SELECT `r.birthplace`; CSV export |
| `server/src/controllers/openApiControllers.js` | 42 | SELECT `r.birthplace` |

**Worst case — line 1591 of barangayServices.js:**
```sql
INSERT INTO residents (
  id, barangay_id, first_name, last_name, ..., birthdate, birthplace, sex, ...
)
```
This is the **bulk Excel import** INSERT path. It will throw `column "birthplace" of relation "residents" does not exist` on every import attempt.

**Impact:** Bulk import is completely broken. Export queries silently omit birth location data. Open API endpoint returns null birthplace.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: `purok_id` Column Written in `householdServices.js` UPDATE and INSERT Paths

**Schema v2:** `households` table has no `purok_id` column.

**Affected file:** `server/src/services/householdServices.js`

| Line | Context |
|---|---|
| 83 | `purok_id` extracted as local variable |
| 252–254 | `updateFields.push('purok_id = $...')` — active UPDATE path |
| 863 | `purok_id` in INSERT column list |
| 528–530 | `h.purok_id` in WHERE clause of SELECT |

**Impact:** Any household create, update, or purok-filtered list query will throw a PostgreSQL `column "purok_id" does not exist` error against the v2 schema.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-4: `purok_id` Referenced in `barangayServices.js` and `municipalityServices.js` Export Queries

**Affected files:**
| File | Lines | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `barangayServices.js` | 1256, 1323, 1328, 1334, 1664, 1689 | `h.purok_id = $param` filter; SELECT includes `h.purok_id` in 3 UNION subqueries |
| `municipalityServices.js` | 242, 309, 314, 320, 454, 479 | Same pattern — filter + 3 UNION SELECTs |

**Impact:** Resident/household export queries crash with `column h.purok_id does not exist` on every export attempt.

---

### 11.2 — BIMS Frontend: Stale Column Name Mismatches

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-5: `resident_status` Used as Field Name Throughout Frontend — Mismatch with Backend Response

**Schema v2 column:** `status`. Backend (`resident.queries.js`) returns it as `r.status`. Frontend reads `resident.resident_status`.

**Affected files:**
| File | Lines | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `ResidentInfoForm.jsx` | 35, 82, 115–116, 142, 446, 449, 452, 466, 468 | Zod schema field, form init, data population, label, Select, error display — all on `resident_status` |
| `ResidentViewDialog.jsx` | 289, 291 | Status badge renders `viewResident.resident_status` |
| `ResidentsPage.jsx` | 618, 652, 686 | Maps `resident.resident_status` and passes it as `residentStatus` to form |
| `AddResidentDialog.jsx` | 139 | Field mapping: `resident_status: "residentStatus"` |

**Impact:** Status badge in resident view always renders blank. Status field in edit form pre-fills blank. Status filtering is broken. A resident's active/inactive/deceased state is invisible throughout the BIMS UI.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-1: `birthplace` Used as Single Field — Mismatch with v2 Schema's 3-Column Split

**Schema v2:** `birth_region`, `birth_province`, `birth_municipality`. No `birthplace` column.

**Affected files:**
| File | Lines | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `ResidentInfoForm.jsx` | 27, 84, 125, 144, 275–279 | Zod field, init, population, single text input |
| `ResidentViewDialog.jsx` | 389 | Displays `viewResident.birthplace` |
| `ResidentsPage.jsx` | 611, 645, 679 | Maps `resident.birthplace` in view/edit/form data |
| `utils/residentSchema.jsx` | 11 | Global schema defines `birthplace: z.string().optional()` |
| `AutoRefreshTest.jsx` | 75 | Test data uses `birthplace: 'Test City'` |

**Impact:** Birth location data is never populated in any form or view. Field submits to/reads from a non-existent backend column. Data is silently discarded.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-6: `ResidentsPage.jsx` Still Fetches Puroks on Mount (LIVE API CALL)

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/ResidentsPage.jsx` (lines 308–316)

```js
// Fetch puroks for filter
useEffect(() => {
    if (!barangayId) return;
    api.get(`/list/${barangayId}/purok`)
```

This fires a live HTTP request every time the Residents page loads. The backend puroks endpoint is a no-op stub (returns `[]`), so it silently fails rather than crashes — but it is a live unnecessary call and sets the stage for regression if the stub is ever removed.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-2: `HouseholdLocationForm.jsx` Submits `purok_id` in API Payload

**File:** `client/src/features/household/components/HouseholdLocationForm.jsx` (lines 60, 87, 139, 272)

Despite the `purokId` Zod field being `.optional()`, line 272 still includes it in the transformed payload:
```js
purok_id: data.purokId,
```

This is submitted directly to the household update endpoint. The backend `householdServices.js` will attempt `SET purok_id = $N` — which crashes on the v2 schema.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-3: `UnemployedHouseholdStats.jsx` Renders `purok_name` Column

**File:** `client/src/features/dashboard/components/UnemployedHouseholdStats.jsx` (lines 45, 73, 95, 117)

Still passes `purokId` as an API query param and maps `item.purok_name` into the table output. With no purok data, every row shows `"N/A"` in the Purok column and the filter param is silently ignored.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-4: `DeleteConfirmationDialog.jsx` (Households) Renders `purok_name`

**File:** `client/src/features/household/components/DeleteConfirmationDialog.jsx` (lines 58, 66)

Renders `{data.purok_name}` inline in the confirmation dialog. Will show blank/undefined when presented to user.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-5: `PetsPage.jsx` — Full Live Purok Stack

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/PetsPage.jsx`

Lines 15, 37, 41, 82, 85, 83, 260, 424:
- `useState([])` for puroks
- `useEffect` fetches `GET /list/{target_id}/purok` on mount
- Passes `queryParams.purokId = filterPurok` on every fetch
- Passes `puroks` prop to filter child
- Line 1076: renders `{selectedPet.purok_name || "-"}` in pet detail view

Live API call on every page load. Filter param fires on every list fetch.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: Puroks Feature Directory Fully Intact — 3 Live Component Files

**Directory:** `client/src/features/barangay/puroks/components/`

Files present and containing live code:
- `AddPurokDialog.jsx` — full modal with form, POST to purok API
- `EditPurokDialog.jsx` — uses `purok.purok_name` (lines 49, 103, 117)
- `DeleteConfirmationDialog.jsx` — uses `purok?.purok_name` (line 53)

These components are not mounted from any active route (per previous audit, `PuroksPage` is commented out in `App.jsx`). However, they are exported and importable. The feature directory being fully intact with live code creates ongoing confusion and a re-regression risk.

---

### 11.3 — E-Services Backend: Stale Socket/API Contracts

#### 🟠 MAJOR-6: `socket.service.ts` Emits to `subscriber:` and `citizen:` Rooms — Frontend Joins These

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/services/socket.service.ts` (lines 96, 104–105, 110–113, 469–517)

Backend still emits:
- `io.to('subscriber:{id}').emit('subscriber:update', ...)` — line 104
- `io.to('user:{id}').emit(...)` with payload including `subscriberId` — line 113
- `io.to('admins').emit('citizen:update', { citizenId, ... })` — line 483
- `io.to('admins').emit('citizen:status-change', ...)` — line 505

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/socket/socket.ts` (lines 258–272)

Socket server still registers:
```ts
socket.on('subscribe:subscriber', (subscriberId) => { socket.join(`subscriber:${subscriberId}`) })
socket.on('unsubscribe:subscriber', ...)
```

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/context/SocketContext.tsx` (lines 26–27, 118–119, 231–234, 238–241)

Frontend `SocketContext` calls `subscribeToSubscriber(subscriberId)` / `unsubscribeFromSubscriber(subscriberId)` which emit these exact events.

**Assessment:** The subscriber room pattern (`subscriber:{id}`) is still functionally used end-to-end — frontend joins it, backend emits to it. This is not broken, but the terminology mismatch (`subscriber` vs `resident`) means any future dev adding real-time notifications for a resident will need to know this undocumented internal socket room naming.

**The `citizen:update` / `citizen:status-change` events** are emitted by the backend but the frontend `socket.types.ts` still defines `CitizenUpdatePayload` with `citizenId` — the frontend is listening for these with old field names. If any admin page uses these events for live updates, it receives `citizenId` instead of `residentId`.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-7: `modals/index.ts` Exports from Non-Existent Directories

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/modals/index.ts`

```ts
export * from './subscribers';   // ← directory DOES NOT EXIST
export * from './citizens';      // ← directory DOES NOT EXIST
```

The `subscribers/` and `citizens/` modal directories were deleted (confirmed by `ls` — neither exists). This barrel export will throw a **module not found** error at build time — the entire frontend build fails.

**This is a build-breaking error.**

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-8: `PortalEServices.tsx` Calls Removed Endpoint `/api/e-services`

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/pages/portal/PortalEServices.tsx` (lines 19, 48)

```ts
import { eServiceService } from '@/services/api/eservice.service';
const result = await eServiceService.getAllEServices(); // calls GET /api/e-services
```

**File:** `multysis-backend/src/index.ts` (line 318)

```ts
// eserviceRoutes removed (AC1) — eservices table dropped; portal uses /api/services/active
```

The route is removed. Every visit to the E-Services portal page (`/portal/e-services`) will receive a **404** response and display nothing.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-7: `dashboard.service.ts` Interface Has Stale Fields — `subscriberGrowthTrends` Uses `citizens`/`nonCitizens`

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/dashboard.service.ts` (lines 9, 20, 23, 31)

```ts
totalSubscribers: number;        // ← stale alias
subscriberGrowthTrends: Array<{ date: string; citizens: number; nonCitizens: number }>;  // ← stale
citizensByStatus: Record<string, number>;  // ← stale
recentCitizens: Array<{ ... residencyStatus: string; ... }>;  // ← stale
recentTransactions: Array<{ subscriberName: string; ... }>;   // ← stale
```

If the backend returns `residents` instead of `citizens`, `nonResidents` instead of `nonCitizens`, `residentName` instead of `subscriberName` — the dashboard charts silently receive `undefined` and display nothing. This entire interface describes v1 data shape.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-8: `SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` Reads `statistics?.citizensByStatus` — Stale Field Name

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/components/admin/dashboard/SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` (lines 44, 53)

```ts
if (!statistics?.citizensByStatus) return [];
return Object.entries(statistics.citizensByStatus)
```

And line 19 of `chartConfig`:
```ts
nonCitizens: { label: 'Non-Residents', color: '...' },
```

If backend now returns `residentsByStatus`, the pie chart remains permanently empty (the `citizensByStatus` field is undefined). The `nonCitizens` chart key also won't match data if the field was renamed.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-9: `useSubscribers.ts` Calls `/api/subscribers` — Endpoint Does Not Exist in v2

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/hooks/subscribers/useSubscribers.ts` (lines 53–88) → calls `subscriberService.getAllSubscribers()` → **File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/subscriber.service.ts` (line 80) → calls `api.get('/subscribers?...')`

This hook is used by `AdminSubscribers.tsx` which renders the residents list. But `AdminSubscribers` was rewritten to use `useResidents` (confirmed). **However**, `useSubscribers` is still imported and called elsewhere if any component uses it.

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/routes/index.tsx` (line 18): `AdminSubscribers` is still lazy-loaded. If any path still mounts the old hook variant, it fires `GET /api/subscribers` → **404**.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-10: `useCitizens.ts` Calls `/api/citizens` — Endpoint Removed

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/hooks/citizens/useCitizens.ts` (calls `citizenService.getAllCitizens()`) → **File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/citizen.service.ts` (line 88) → `api.get('/citizens?...')`

Any component still using `useCitizens` will hit a **404**. The hook imports the `citizenService` which hits `/api/citizens`, `/api/citizens/:id`, `/api/citizens/:id/approve`, etc. — none of these routes exist in the v2 backend.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-11: `AdminAddresses.tsx` Calls `/api/addresses` — Old Lookup Table Removed

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminAddresses.tsx` (line 21) → `useAddresses` hook → `address.service.ts` (line 40) → `api.get('/addresses')` / `api.post('/addresses', ...)`

The E-Services backend **does** have `/api/addresses` mounted (confirmed — `index.ts` line 338). The `address.service.ts` (`multysis-backend`) queries `prisma.municipality` and `prisma.barangay` — which are v2 tables.

**However**, `AdminAddresses.tsx` (line 168) still labels the page: *"Manage addresses for citizens and subscribers"* and the UI still references the old `Address` type (`postalCode`, province fields) that no longer reflects the v2 barangay-based address model. **Functional but semantically incorrect.**

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: `useServiceTransactions.ts` Uses `subscriberId` Field in Transaction Object

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/hooks/services/useServiceTransactions.ts` (line 118)

```ts
subscriberId: data.subscriberId,
```

Maps an incoming socket event payload to a local `Transaction` object using `subscriberId`. If the backend now emits `residentId` in this payload instead, the field is silently undefined. The transaction object will have no linked resident ID.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: `socket.types.ts` Defines `subscriberId`/`citizenId` Throughout — Mismatch with v2 Naming

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/types/socket.types.ts` (lines 85, 95, 131, 141, 148, 166, 173, 182, 192, 231)

Socket event payload types retain `subscriberId` and `citizenId`. If the backend now emits `residentId` in live events (partially — `socket.service.ts` still uses `subscriberId`/`citizenId`), TypeScript will accept the stale field names while the actual runtime value is `undefined`.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-4: `validations/beneficiary.schema.ts` — Field Named `citizenId` for All Beneficiary Forms

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/validations/beneficiary.schema.ts` (lines 41, 50, 72, 81)

```ts
citizenId: z.string().min(1, 'Citizen is required'),
```

The service layer (`social-amelioration.service.ts`) correctly remaps `citizenId → residentId` before sending to backend (`toBackendPayload()` at line 118). So this doesn't break the API call — but the form error message reads *"Citizen is required"* instead of *"Resident is required"*, and any dev inspecting the form data sees `citizenId` instead of `residentId`.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-5: `transaction.service.ts` (Frontend) Still Has `subscriberId` in Transaction Interface

**File:** `multysis-frontend/src/services/api/transaction.service.ts` (line 23)

```ts
subscriberId?: string;
```

The `Transaction` type still exposes `subscriberId`. It should be `residentId` to match v2. Callers accessing `transaction.subscriberId` get `undefined` (backend now sends `residentId`).

---

### 11.4 — Consolidated New Findings

---

## Section 12 — Gap Audit: Dashboard Contract, Pet/Stats Services, AC2–AC4 Pages, Registration Flow (2026-03-25 21:04)

---

### 12.1 — Dashboard Backend vs Frontend Contract Mismatch

The E-Services dashboard is a 3-way mismatch: the **backend type** (`admin.service.ts`), the **backend response** (actual return values), and the **frontend interface** (`dashboard.service.ts`) are all inconsistent with each other.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: `subscriberGrowthTrends` Field Names Mismatch — Chart Is Permanently Empty

**Backend returns** (`admin.service.ts` line 377):
```ts
Array<{ date: string; active: number; pending: number }>
```

**Frontend reads** (`SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` lines 37–38):
```ts
residents: item.residents,
nonResidents: item.nonResidents,
```

The frontend maps `.residents` and `.nonResidents` from each trend item — but the backend sends `.active` and `.pending`. Both fields arrive as `undefined`. The resident growth line chart renders two flat zero lines.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: `recentTransactions[].subscriberName` — Field Never Populated

**Backend returns** (`admin.service.ts` line 172, 389):
```ts
residentName: t.resident ? `${t.resident.firstName} ${t.resident.lastName}` : 'Unknown'
```

**Frontend reads** (`RecentActivity.tsx` line 111):
```ts
{transaction.subscriberName}
```

`subscriberName` is `undefined` — the recent transactions list shows a blank name for every transaction.

**Frontend interface definition** (`dashboard.service.ts` line 31):
```ts
subscriberName: string;   // ← stale; backend returns residentName
```

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-1: `dashboard.service.ts` Declares `totalSubscribers` — Backend Does Not Return It

**Frontend interface** (line 9): `totalSubscribers: number`
**Backend returns** (line 413): `totalResidents` only. No `totalSubscribers` field.

Any UI component reading `statistics.totalSubscribers` gets `undefined`. `SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` (line 66) uses `statistics.totalSubscribers ?? 0` as fallback, so it silently shows 0 rather than crash.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-2: `subscriberGrowthTrends` — Backend Type Defines `active`/`pending`, Frontend Type Defines `citizens`/`nonCitizens`

Three separate definitions of the same structure, all inconsistent:

| Location | Field names |
|---|---|
| `admin.service.ts` backend type (line 161) | `{ date, active, pending }` |
| `admin.service.ts` actual return (line 377) | `{ date, active, pending }` |
| `dashboard.service.ts` frontend type (line 20) | `{ date, citizens, nonCitizens }` |
| `SubscriberAnalytics.tsx` actual read (lines 37–38) | `.residents`, `.nonResidents` |

None of the three match.

---

### 12.2 — `statisticsServices.js`: `purok_id` in Active Statistic Queries

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: 24 Active `h.purok_id` References in Statistics Service — Guarded But Armed

**File:** `server/src/services/statisticsServices.js`

All 24 occurrences of `h.purok_id` are inside conditional blocks (`if (purokId) { ... }`). This means they only execute when a `purokId` filter is passed as a query parameter. They do **not** crash on every request — but they **will** crash if any caller passes `purokId`.

**Current situation:** Frontend `PetsPage.jsx` and `UnemployedHouseholdStats.jsx` still pass `purokId` to API endpoints (Section 11 findings 11 and 13). Those values are empty strings or `undefined` after puroks were removed from state — but the parameter is still appended to requests. Whether they trigger the `if (purokId)` branch depends on truthiness evaluation in the service layer.

**Affected stat methods** (all follow the same pattern):
- `getAgeDemographics`
- `getGenderDemographics`
- `getCivilStatusDemographics`
- `getEducationAttainmentDemographics`
- `getEmploymentStatusDemographics`
- `getHouseholdSizeDemographics`
- And related household/population methods

**Impact:** If any frontend component passes a non-empty `purokId` to any statistics endpoint, the query will attempt `WHERE h.purok_id = $N` — which throws `column h.purok_id does not exist` against the v2 schema.

---

### 12.3 — `certificateService.js`: Non-Existent Schema Columns Referenced

#### 🟠 MAJOR-3: `r.nationality` and `r.religion` Queried — Columns Do Not Exist in Schema v2

**File:** `server/src/services/certificateService.js` (lines 166–167)

```js
data['resident.nationality'] = r.nationality || 'Filipino';
data['resident.religion']    = r.religion || '';
```

The service does `SELECT r.*` from `residents`, then reads `r.nationality` and `r.religion`. Neither column exists in the v2 `residents` table. They will always be `undefined`, silently falling back to `'Filipino'` and `''` respectively.

**Impact:** Certificate templates using `{{ resident.nationality }}` or `{{ resident.religion }}` will always output the hardcoded fallback, never actual data. Not a crash — a silent data accuracy failure.

---

### 12.4 — AC2 / AC3 / AC4 Implementation Verification

#### ✅ AC2 — Guest Application Flow: IMPLEMENTED

- `PortalGuestApply.tsx` exists at `multysis-frontend/src/pages/portal/PortalGuestApply.tsx`
- `PortalTrack.tsx` exists at `multysis-frontend/src/pages/portal/PortalTrack.tsx`
- Both routed in `routes/index.tsx`: `/portal/apply-as-guest` and `/portal/track`
- E-Services backend `portal-registration.service.ts` correctly handles guest transaction path

#### ✅ AC3 — Unified Certificate Queue: IMPLEMENTED

- `CertificatesPage.jsx` exists at `client/src/pages/admin/barangay/CertificatesPage.jsx`
- Routed in `App.jsx` at path `/admin/barangay/certificates`
- `certificateRoutes.js` registered in `app.js` at `/api/certificates`

#### ✅ AC4 — Template-Based Certificate Generation: IMPLEMENTED

- `CertificateTemplatesPage.jsx` and `TemplateEditorPage.jsx` exist in `client/src/pages/admin/certificates/`
- Both routed in `App.jsx` at `/certificate-templates` and `/certificate-templates/:id`
- `certificateService.js` implements token resolution and Puppeteer PDF generation

#### ✅ AC2 — Portal Registration Flow: IMPLEMENTED

- `PortalMyID.tsx` and `PortalMyHousehold.tsx` exist and are routed
- `RegistrationApprovalsPage.jsx` exists and routed at `/admin/.../registrations`
- `BulkIDPage.jsx` and `GeoSetupPage.jsx` exist and are routed

---

### 12.5 — Registration Approval Flow: Column Usage Verified

#### ✅ BIMS Backend (`registrationRoutes.js`) — CLEAN

Approval flow uses `UPDATE residents SET status = 'active', resident_id = $1` — correct v2 column names. Reject flow uses `status = 'rejected'`. No references to `resident_status`, `birthplace`, or `purok_id`.

#### ✅ E-Services Backend (`portal-registration.service.ts`) — CLEAN

`tx.resident.create({...})` uses Prisma camelCase mappings: `birthRegion`, `birthProvince`, `birthMunicipality`, `status: 'pending'`. All correct v2 field names via Prisma model.

---

### 12.6 — Pet Backend: Purok Filter Confirmed Contained

#### 🟢 PASS: `petsServices.js` and `pets.queries.js` — No Purok SQL

Neither file contains any reference to `purok_id`, `puroks`, or `purok_name`. Pet backend queries are clean against v2 schema. The live purok fetch in `PetsPage.jsx` hits a backend stub that returns `[]` — no crash, but an unnecessary API call on every page load.

---

### 12.7 — Summary of New Findings

| # | Finding | System | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `subscriberGrowthTrends` items: backend sends `{active, pending}`, frontend reads `{residents, nonResidents}` — chart permanently empty | E-Services Dashboard | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 2 | `recentTransactions[].subscriberName`: backend sends `residentName`, frontend renders `subscriberName` — all names blank | E-Services Dashboard | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 3 | `statisticsServices.js` — 24 `h.purok_id` references inside `if (purokId)` guards; frontend still sends `purokId` param from some paths — conditional crash | BIMS Backend | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 4 | `totalSubscribers` declared in frontend interface but never returned by backend — silently 0 | E-Services Dashboard | 🟠 MAJOR |
| 5 | `subscriberGrowthTrends` type defined 3 different ways across backend type, backend return, and frontend type — none match | E-Services Dashboard | 🟠 MAJOR |
| 6 | `certificateService.js` reads `r.nationality` and `r.religion` — neither column exists in v2 `residents` table; always falls back to hardcoded default | BIMS Backend | 🟠 MAJOR |
| 7 | AC2 guest flow, AC3 certificate queue, AC4 template generation: all pages exist and are routed | All | ✅ PASS |
| 8 | Registration approval SQL uses correct v2 column names (`status`, not `resident_status`) | BIMS Backend | ✅ PASS |
| 9 | Pet backend has no purok column references | BIMS Backend | ✅ PASS |

*Section 12 added: 2026-03-25 21:04 | Vex 🔬*

---

## Section 13 — System Flow Audit: How Both Systems Work Together (2026-03-25 21:14)

**Purpose:** Map the complete end-to-end user flows across BIMS and E-Services, identify integration points, and surface flow gaps. Intended to support creation of a user guide for simultaneous use of both systems.

---

### 13.1 — System Architecture Overview

Two independent applications sharing one PostgreSQL database:

| | BIMS | E-Services (Multysis) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who uses it** | Barangay/municipality staff | Residents (portal) + E-Services admins |
| **Frontend URL** | `http://localhost:5173` (dev) | `http://localhost:5174` (dev) |
| **Backend URL** | `http://localhost:5000/api` | `http://localhost:3000/api` |
| **Backend type** | Node.js + Express + raw SQL | TypeScript + Express + Prisma |
| **Database access** | `pg` pool (raw SQL) | Prisma ORM |
| **Shared secret** | `JWT_SECRET` (must be identical in both `.env` files) | Same |

**Critical constraint:** Both backends connect to the **same PostgreSQL database**. BIMS uses raw SQL via `pg` pool. E-Services uses Prisma. They write to the same `residents`, `registration_requests`, `households`, `families`, `transactions`, and related tables.

**Cross-system calls:** The E-Services portal frontend makes direct HTTP calls to the **BIMS backend** for household data (`VITE_BIMS_API_BASE_URL`). The BIMS backend validates portal JWT tokens using the shared `JWT_SECRET`.

---

### 13.2 — Flow 1: Resident Self-Registration

**Who:** New resident → E-Services portal → BIMS staff review

```
[PORTAL] Resident visits /portal/register
  → 4-step wizard (ResidentRegister.tsx):
      Step 1: Personal info (name, birthdate, sex, civil status)
      Step 2: Address (barangay dropdown from /api/addresses/barangays + street)
      Step 3: ID documents + selfie upload
      Step 4: Create username + password
  → POST /api/portal-registration/register (E-Services backend)
      Creates: residents (status='pending') + resident_credentials + registration_requests
  → Resident sees RegistrationStatus page at /portal/register/status

[BIMS] Staff logs in → /admin/barangay/registrations (or /admin/municipality/registrations)
  → RegistrationApprovalsPage.jsx
  → GET /api/portal-registration/requests (BIMS backend, port 5000)
  → Staff clicks "Under Review" → PATCH /api/portal-registration/requests/:id/under-review
  → Staff clicks "Approve" or "Reject" → POST /api/portal-registration/requests/:id/review

[ON APPROVE — E-Services backend path via RegistrationApprovalsPage:]
  → UPDATE residents SET status='active', resident_id=generated
  → UPDATE registration_requests SET status='approved'
  → Email sent to resident with temp password + login link (via E-Services email service)
  → Resident can now log in at /portal/login

[PORTAL] Resident logs in → /portal/login
  → Sees resident ID at /portal/my-id
  → Can register household at /portal/my-household
  → Can apply for services at /portal/e-government
```

**Note:** The BIMS `RegistrationApprovalsPage` calls the **BIMS backend** (`/api/portal-registration/...` at port 5000). The BIMS backend handles approval but does NOT send email (no email service imported in `registrationRoutes.js`). Email only fires from the **E-Services backend** approval path. This means: if the approval was done via the BIMS admin panel, **no email is sent to the resident.**

---

### 13.3 — Flow 2: Household Registration

**Who:** Approved resident → E-Services portal → BIMS reads

```
[PORTAL] Resident visits /portal/my-household (PortalMyHousehold.tsx)
  → GET request sent directly to BIMS backend:
      VITE_BIMS_API_BASE_URL + /portal/household/my
      Auth: portal JWT token (validated by BIMS using shared JWT_SECRET)
  → If no household: resident fills form → POST to BIMS /api/portal/household
      (INSERT INTO households — no purok_id, just barangay_id + street)
  → To add family member: POST to BIMS /api/portal/household/:id/members
      Member lookup: by resident_id only (no free-text names)
      Validation: member must be active + not already in another household

[BIMS] Staff can view household in /admin/barangay/households (HouseholdsPage)
  → Read-only household view
  → Staff cannot create households directly (R2 architecture requirement)
```

---

### 13.4 — Flow 3: Certificate Request (Two Entry Points)

**Who:** Resident or walk-in visitor → BIMS staff processes

```
ENTRY POINT A — Portal resident:
  [PORTAL] /portal/e-government → selects certificate service
  → RequestServiceModal.tsx → POST /api/transactions (E-Services backend)
      Writes to: transactions table (service.category = 'Barangay Certificate')
      resident_id: set (if logged in) | null (if guest via /portal/apply-as-guest)

ENTRY POINT B — Walk-in counter:
  [BIMS] Staff at counter manually enters request
  → POST /api/public/requests/certificate (BIMS backend)
      Writes to: requests table
  (Note: The old public Certificates page at /public/request still exists but
   shows a notice that the walk-in form has been retired — staff use BIMS counter)

PROCESSING (unified queue):
  [BIMS] Staff opens /admin/barangay/certificates (CertificatesPage.jsx)
  → GET /api/certificates/queue (BIMS backend)
      Returns: UNION ALL of requests (walk-in) + transactions (portal)
      Filtered by: barangay_id, status, source (walkin/portal)
  → Staff clicks "Generate PDF"
      → POST /api/certificates/generate/request/:id  (walk-in)
      → POST /api/certificates/generate/transaction/:id  (portal)
      → certificateService.js resolves {{ placeholders }} → Puppeteer PDF
  → Staff updates status:
      Walk-in: PUT /api/certificates/queue/walkin/:id/status
      Portal:  PUT /api/certificates/queue/portal/:id/status
```

---

### 13.5 — Flow 4: Guest Application

**Who:** Non-resident (no portal account) → E-Services portal → BIMS staff

```
[PORTAL] Visitor visits /portal/apply-as-guest (PortalGuestApply.tsx)
  → Fills: name, contact, email, address (free text — no barangay FK)
  → Selects service → POST /api/transactions (E-Services backend)
      transactions.resident_id = NULL
      transactions.applicant_name/contact/email/address populated
      Reference number generated (TXN-YYYY-XXXXXX)

[PORTAL] Visitor visits /portal/track?ref=TXN-... (PortalTrack.tsx)
  → Public lookup by reference number — no login required
  → Shows status, notes

[BIMS] Guest transactions appear in certificate queue with source='portal'
  → Staff processes same as resident portal submissions
  → Note: guest transactions have NO barangay_id (applicant_address is free text)
    → They appear in the queue but CANNOT be filtered by barangay
    → Staff must manually determine which barangay handles the request
```

---

### 13.6 — Flow 5: Resident ID

**Who:** Approved resident → portal view; BIMS admin → bulk download

```
[PORTAL] /portal/my-id (PortalMyID.tsx)
  → Calls E-Services backend for resident profile
  → Displays ID card with:
      - resident_id (e.g. RES-2025-0000001)
      - QR code pointing to: VITE_PORTAL_URL + /portal/register/status?username=...
      - Profile photo (from BIMS backend uploads folder via BACKEND_URL)

[BIMS] Municipality admin: /admin/municipality/bulk-id (BulkIDPage.jsx)
  → Filter by barangay, date range
  → Bulk PDF download — one ID card per resident
  → ID background images from: municipalities.id_background_front_path / id_background_back_path
```

---

### 13.7 — Flow 6: GeoMap Setup (First-Time BIMS Setup)

**Who:** Municipality admin → one-time setup before anything else works

```
[BIMS] Admin logs in → /admin/municipality/geo-setup (GeoSetupPage.jsx)
  → Leaflet map loads — fetches GeoJSON from:
      GET /api/gis/municipality and GET /api/gis/barangays/:muniCode
  → Admin clicks their municipality on the map
  → POST /api/setup/municipality (BIMS backend)
      Reads PSGC code from GeoJSON feature → creates municipalities row
      Auto-creates all barangays from GeoJSON barangay features
  → Portal address dropdowns are now populated:
      GET /api/addresses/municipalities (E-Services backend)
      GET /api/addresses/barangays?municipalityId=1 (E-Services backend)
```

**Required before GeoMap setup works:**
- `seed_gis.sql` must be loaded into the database (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Without GIS data: map renders empty, barangays cannot be auto-created, portal registration address dropdown is empty, registration is non-functional

---

### 13.8 — Flow Gaps Found

#### 🔴 GAP-1: BIMS Approval Does NOT Send Email to Resident

**Where it breaks:** `registrationRoutes.js` (BIMS backend, port 5000) — the approval handler has no email service. `RegistrationApprovalsPage.jsx` calls the BIMS backend.

The **E-Services backend** (`portal-registration.service.ts`) sends approval email with temp password. But the BIMS admin panel calls the BIMS backend, not the E-Services backend.

**Result:** Residents approved by BIMS staff receive **no notification**. They have no way to know their registration was approved unless they manually check their portal status page. The temp password reset mechanism in the E-Services approval path is never triggered from the BIMS side.

**This is a broken workflow for the primary user journey.**

---

#### 🔴 GAP-2: Two Parallel Approval Endpoints — No Single Source of Truth

Both backends have a `POST /api/portal-registration/requests/:id/review` endpoint:
- **BIMS backend** (port 5000) — `registrationRoutes.js`: raw SQL UPDATE, no email
- **E-Services backend** (port 3000) — `portal-registration.routes.ts` → `portal-registration.service.ts`: Prisma UPDATE + email

`RegistrationApprovalsPage.jsx` calls the **BIMS backend** (confirmed — `apiClient` base URL is `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = BIMS backend). The E-Services approval path (with email) is never triggered from the BIMS admin interface.

Since both write to the same `residents` and `registration_requests` tables, a race condition is possible if both endpoints were ever called concurrently (e.g. a future E-Services admin UI also calls approve). No distributed lock exists between the two backends beyond PostgreSQL-level row locking.

---

#### 🔴 GAP-3: Guest Transactions Have No Barangay Routing

**Where it breaks:** `transactions` table — guest rows have `resident_id = NULL` and `applicant_address` as free text. No `barangay_id` FK.

The certificate queue in BIMS filters by `barangay_id`. Guest transactions belong to no barangay. They appear in every barangay's queue (or none, depending on the WHERE filter), creating ambiguity about which barangay staff is responsible for processing the request.

**No routing mechanism exists** — staff have no way to assign or route a guest transaction to the correct barangay based on the free-text `applicant_address`.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-4: BIMS GuidePage Does Not Mention Portal or Cross-System Flows

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/GuidePage.jsx`

The BIMS in-app guide (`/admin/.../guide`) describes BIMS features only. It contains no mention of:
- The E-Services portal (where residents register)
- The registration approval workflow and what happens after approval
- That certificate requests can come from the portal
- That household data is entered by residents in the portal (not by staff in BIMS)

BIMS step 2 of "Quick Start" says: *"Add your first residents and households"* — but this is architecturally wrong. Staff cannot add residents or households directly (R2). The guide contradicts the system design.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-5: `CitizenRegister.tsx` — Stale Registration Page Exists Alongside `ResidentRegister.tsx`

**Files:**
- `multysis-frontend/src/pages/portal/ResidentRegister.tsx` — current v2 registration page, routed at `/portal/register`
- `multysis-frontend/src/pages/portal/CitizenRegister.tsx` — old v1 registration page (calls `citizenRegistrationService` → `/api/portal-registration` after a rename, but uses v1 schema/field names)

Both pages exist. Only `ResidentRegister.tsx` is routed in `routes/index.tsx`. But `CitizenRegister.tsx` exists with full live code and is importable. A developer could accidentally wire it back in.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-6: Approval Flow Shows No Resident ID Document / Selfie to BIMS Reviewer

**File:** `RegistrationApprovalsPage.jsx`

The approval table shows: full name, username, barangay, submitted date, status. No selfie photo, no uploaded ID document preview.

`registration_requests.selfie_url` is stored but never rendered in the approval UI. `residents.proof_of_identification` (the uploaded ID document) is also never shown.

A BIMS staff member approving a registration has no visual verification tool — they cannot see the resident's photo or ID document to confirm identity before approving. This is a significant real-world workflow gap for a government system.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-7: No Resident Notification Path from BIMS for Rejection

BIMS `registrationRoutes.js` rejection handler: `UPDATE residents SET status='rejected'` + `UPDATE registration_requests SET status='rejected'`. No email sent.

Residents who are rejected get no notification. They can only discover rejection by manually checking `/portal/register/status`.

---

#### 🟡 GAP-8: BIMS GuidePage References `/admin/barangay/requests` — Route Redirects Away

**File:** `GuidePage.jsx` barangay features section

References path `/admin/barangay/requests` with description *"Process resident certificate and document requests."*

In `App.jsx` line 278: `<Route path="requests" element={<Navigate to="/admin/barangay/certificates" replace />} />`

The guide sends staff to a path that silently redirects. The guide description and route label are stale.

---

#### 🟡 GAP-9: No Cross-System Notification When Resident Registers

When a resident submits a registration in the portal, BIMS staff have no real-time notification. Staff must manually poll the `/admin/.../registrations` page to check for new submissions. No badge count, no Socket.io event, no email to the barangay/municipality admin indicating a new registration request is pending.

---

#### 🟡 GAP-10: BIMS `VITE_EXTERNAL_API_URL` in `apiConfig.js` Points to Hardcoded IP

**File:** `client/src/config/apiConfig.js` (line 4)

```js
BASE_URL: import.meta.env.VITE_EXTERNAL_API_URL || "http://3.104.0.203",
```

This config is used for external GIS/city API integrations. The hardcoded fallback `http://3.104.0.203` is a live IP address — likely a staging or old production server. A developer who doesn't set `VITE_EXTERNAL_API_URL` will silently hit this external server.

---

## Section 14 — First-Time Setup Flow: Full Municipality Onboarding Sequence (2026-03-25 21:44)

**Purpose:** Document the complete ordered sequence required to bring both systems live from a fresh database. Intended as a reference for the developer creating the user guide.

---

### 14.1 — Prerequisites (Before Any Admin Logs In)

These must be completed by a system administrator at the infrastructure level before any browser-based setup can begin.

| Step | Action | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create PostgreSQL database | `createdb united_systems` (or Supabase project) |
| 2 | Apply schema | `psql "$DB_URL" -f united-database/schema.sql` |
| 3 | Load base seed data | `psql "$DB_URL" -f united-database/seed.sql` — creates roles, permissions, services, FAQs |
| 4 | Load GIS geometry data | `psql "$DB_URL" -f united-database/seed_gis.sql` — **required for GeoMap; without this the entire setup UI is non-functional** |
| 5 | Configure BIMS backend `.env` | Set `PG_*` database credentials, `JWT_SECRET` (min 32 chars), `PORT=5000`, `GMAIL_USER`/`GMAIL_PASS` (for emails), `CORS_ORIGIN` (include portal URL) |
| 6 | Configure E-Services backend `.env` | Set `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` (**must be identical to BIMS**), `PORT=3000`, `PORTAL_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, SMTP settings, Google OAuth (optional) |
| 7 | Configure E-Services frontend `.env` | Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (E-Services backend), `VITE_BIMS_API_BASE_URL` (BIMS backend), `VITE_PORTAL_URL`, Supabase keys (for Google OAuth) |
| 8 | Generate Prisma client | `cd multysis-backend && npx prisma generate` |
| 9 | Create the first BIMS municipality admin account | Insert directly into `bims_users` table with role `municipality`, or use the seed script's `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variables |
| 10 | Create the first E-Services admin account | Insert into `eservice_users` table with appropriate role, or use dev endpoint if `NODE_ENV=development` |
| 11 | Start all 4 services | BIMS backend (5000), BIMS frontend (5173), E-Services backend (3000), E-Services frontend (5174) |

---

### 14.2 — Phase 1: Municipality Setup (BIMS — Municipality Admin)

**Who:** Municipality admin (the first BIMS account created above)  
**Where:** BIMS frontend — `http://localhost:5173`  
**Enforced by:** `SetupGuard`/`SetupRouter` — any authenticated municipality admin without `municipalities.setup_status = 'active'` is redirected to `/admin/municipality/setup` automatically

```
[Step 1] Log in to BIMS at /admin/login

[Step 2] System auto-redirects to /admin/municipality/setup (MunicipalitySetupForm)
  Form requires:
  - Click municipality on the interactive GeoMap (Leaflet — reads from gis_municipality table)
    → Populates: municipality name, GIS code automatically
  - Enter: Region, Province (free text — not in GIS data)
  - Upload: Municipality Logo (required — PNG/JPG)
  - Upload: ID Card Background Front (optional — used for resident ID cards)
  - Upload: ID Card Background Back (optional)

  On submit → PUT /{targetId}/municipality (multipart/form-data)
    → Saves logo/background images to uploads/
    → Updates municipalities record with region, province, logo paths
    → Sets setup_status = 'active'

[Step 3] GeoMap confirmation (GeoSetupPage — /admin/municipality/geo-setup)
  → POST /api/setup/municipality { gis_municipality_code }
  → Creates municipalities row
  → Auto-creates all barangay rows from gis_barangay table
  → Portal address dropdowns are now functional
```

**Note:** The MunicipalitySetupForm (step 2) and the GeoSetupPage (step 3) are two separate UI paths that both write to the `municipalities` table. The setup form (`PUT /{id}/municipality`) writes logo/images and metadata. The GeoSetupPage (`POST /api/setup/municipality`) creates barangays from GIS. Both must be completed for the system to be fully operational. There is no enforced order between them and no single combined setup wizard.

---

### 14.3 — Phase 2: Barangay Account Creation (BIMS — Municipality Admin)

**Who:** Municipality admin  
**Where:** BIMS → `/admin/municipality/barangays` (BarangaysPage)

```
[Step 1] Municipality admin navigates to Barangays page
  → Lists all auto-created barangays (from GeoMap setup)

[Step 2] Click "Create Barangay Account" for a barangay
  → Fill: barangay admin full name, email
  → POST /api/barangay → creates bims_users account (role: barangay)

[Step 3] System sends setup email to the barangay admin:
  → POST /api/send-setup-email
  → POST /api/generate-setup-token → generates one-time JWT setup link
  → Email contains link: {BASE_URL}/setup-account?token=...
  → Link expires (token-based)

[If email fails] Municipality admin can resend the setup email later from the Barangays page
```

---

### 14.4 — Phase 3: Barangay Account Activation (BIMS — Barangay Admin)

**Who:** Newly created barangay admin (received email from Phase 2)  
**Where:** BIMS → `/setup-account?token=...` (SetupAccount.jsx)

```
[Step 1] Barangay admin clicks link in setup email
  → Validates token: POST /api/validate-setup-token
  → If token invalid/expired → error shown, must request resend from municipality admin

[Step 2] SetupAccount form:
  - Set password (min 8 chars, uppercase + lowercase + number required)
  - Confirm password

[Step 3] On submit → account activated, redirected to BIMS login

[Step 4] Barangay admin logs in → auto-redirected to /admin/barangay/setup (BarangaySetupForm)
  Form requires:
  - Confirm barangay name and code (pre-filled from GIS)
  - Enter: email, contact number
  - Upload: Barangay Logo (required)
  - Upload: Certificate Background (optional — used on printed certificates)
  - Upload: Organization Chart image (optional)
  - Select barangay boundary on map (MunicipalityBarangaysMap)

  On submit → PUT /{targetId}/barangay (multipart/form-data)
    → Saves images to uploads/
    → Sets barangay setup_status = 'active'
    → Redirects to /admin/barangay/dashboard
```

---

### 14.5 — Phase 4: Certificate Template Setup (BIMS — Municipality Admin)

**Who:** Municipality admin  
**Where:** BIMS → `/admin/municipality/certificate-templates` (CertificateTemplatesPage)

```
[Step 1] Navigate to Certificate Templates
  → GET /api/certificates/templates?municipalityId={id}
  → Lists existing templates (empty on fresh install)

[Step 2] Click "New Template" → /admin/municipality/certificate-templates/new (TemplateEditorPage)
  → Enter: template name, certificate type (e.g. 'barangay_clearance')
  → Write HTML content with {{ placeholder }} tokens (see OVERHAUL.md §14 for full token list)
  → Preview rendered output before saving
  → POST /api/certificates/templates

[Step 3] Activate template → PUT /api/certificates/templates/:id { isActive: true }

[Repeat] for each certificate type the municipality uses:
  barangay_clearance, indigency, residency, good_moral, etc.
```

**Note:** Templates are municipality-wide. All barangays under the municipality share the same templates. Individual barangays cannot have different templates per type.

---

### 14.6 — Phase 5: E-Services Admin Setup

**Who:** E-Services admin (created during infrastructure setup)  
**Where:** E-Services admin panel — `http://localhost:5174/admin`

```
[Step 1] Log in at /admin/login

[Step 2] Configure services:
  → /admin/general-settings/smart-city-services
  → Activate/configure services that residents can apply for
  → Services are pre-seeded from seed.sql (certificate services + more)

[Step 3] Configure tax profiles (if applicable):
  → /admin/general-settings/tax-profiles
  → Set computation rules per service

[Step 4] Configure FAQs:
  → /admin/general-settings/faq
  → Edit or add portal FAQ entries

[Step 5] Configure government programs:
  → /admin/general-settings/government-program
  → Enable programs for social amelioration module

[Step 6] Manage user roles and permissions:
  → /admin/access-control/role-management
  → /admin/access-control/permissions
  → /admin/access-control/user-management
```

---

### 14.7 — Phase 6: System Is Live — Normal Operations Begin

At this point, both systems are operational:

| Capability | Ready |
|---|---|
| Portal residents can register | ✅ (address dropdowns populated from GIS) |
| BIMS staff can review registrations | ✅ |
| Residents can log in and view ID card | ✅ (after approval) |
| Residents can register household | ✅ |
| Residents can apply for services | ✅ |
| Walk-in certificate requests | ✅ |
| Certificate PDF generation | ✅ (requires templates from Phase 4) |
| Bulk resident ID download | ✅ (requires ID background from Phase 1) |

---

### 14.8 — Setup Flow Gaps Found

#### 🔴 GAP-11: No Enforced Setup Order Between MunicipalitySetupForm and GeoSetupPage

`MunicipalitySetupForm` (uploads logo, writes metadata to `municipalities`) and `GeoSetupPage` (creates barangays from GIS) are **two independent pages** that both need to be completed. There is no wizard that combines them, no check that both are done, and no UI indication that one must follow the other.

A municipality admin who completes the logo upload form but skips `GeoSetupPage` will reach the dashboard with a configured municipality but **zero barangays**. The portal address dropdowns will be empty. Resident registration will fail at address step.

Conversely, a municipality admin who does GeoSetupPage first (auto-creates barangays) but skips the logo form will have no ID card backgrounds configured. All generated ID cards will be blank.

**There is no completion checklist or validation that both setup steps are done.**

---

#### 🔴 GAP-12: Barangay Setup Token Has No Documented Expiry or Resend Flow

`buildSetupLink.js` calls `POST /api/generate-setup-token`. `SetupAccount.jsx` validates with `POST /api/validate-setup-token`. The token is JWT-based, so it expires.

However:
- Token expiry duration is not documented anywhere in the frontend or `.env.example`
- There is no "Resend setup email" button visible on the `SetupAccount` page when a token is expired
- The fallback in `buildSetupLink.js` (if token generation fails) falls back to plain URL parameters with no security — barangay name, code, and email exposed in the URL

A barangay admin who delays clicking the setup link gets an expired-token error with no self-service recovery path. They must contact the municipality admin to resend from `BarangaysPage`.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-13: Certificate Templates Must Be Set Up Before Certificate Queue Is Useful — No Prompt Exists

When a barangay staff member first opens `/admin/barangay/certificates`, the queue may have requests waiting. Clicking "Generate PDF" on any item will fail if no certificate template has been uploaded for that certificate type (`certificateService.js` returns an error if no template found).

The BIMS UI shows no warning that templates are required. Staff see the queue, click Generate, get an error, and have no indication why. There is no link from the certificate queue to the template management page, and template management is only accessible to municipality admin (not barangay admin).

---

#### 🟠 GAP-14: E-Services Has No Guided Setup — Services Are Pre-Seeded But Inactive by Default

`seed.sql` inserts 9 certificate-type services with `is_active = false` (or no explicit active flag). There is no first-run wizard for the E-Services admin. On fresh install, the portal's services list is empty until an admin manually activates services via the admin panel.

A portal visitor on a fresh install sees "No services available" with no explanation.

---

#### 🟠 GAP-15: No Single "System Readiness" Check Across Both Systems

There is no endpoint or UI page that shows whether both systems are fully configured end-to-end:
- GIS loaded?
- Municipality configured?
- Barangays created?
- At least one barangay account active?
- Certificate templates uploaded?
- E-Services services activated?

Each subsystem has its own `GET /api/setup/status` check, but no unified dashboard or health check spans both backends. A deployer has no single place to confirm the system is ready for residents.

*Section 14 added: 2026-03-25 21:44 | Vex 🔬*

---

## Section 15 — Full Purok Remnant Audit (2026-03-25 22:08)

**Method:** Full codebase grep for all `purok*` references (case-insensitive), excluding `archive/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, and lines that are only inline removal comments. Every remaining live reference verified.

---

### 15.1 — Database Layer

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: `household.queries.js` — `purok_id` in Active INSERT and UPDATE SQL

**File:** `server/src/queries/household.queries.js`

| Lines | Query | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | INSERT (query 1) | `purok_id` in column list |
| 68 | UPDATE (query 1) | `purok_id = $4` |
| 232 | INSERT (query 2) | `purok_id` in column list |
| 251 | UPDATE (query 2) | `purok_id = $4` |

These are the raw SQL query strings used by `householdControllers.js` and `householdServices.js`. The `households` table in v2 has no `purok_id` column. Any household INSERT or UPDATE that flows through these queries will throw `column "purok_id" of relation "households" does not exist`.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: `barangay.queries.js` — `INSERT_PUROK` / `UPDATE_PUROK` Exported and Imported

**File:** `server/src/queries/barangay.queries.js` (lines 31–45)

```sql
export const INSERT_PUROK = `
  INSERT INTO puroks (barangay_id, purok_name, purok_leader, description)...`

export const UPDATE_PUROK = `
  UPDATE puroks SET purok_name = $3, purok_leader = $4...`
```

Both are exported. Both are **imported** into `server/src/services/barangayServices.js` (lines 8–9). The `puroks` table does not exist in v2 schema. If any code path reaches these queries, PostgreSQL throws `relation "puroks" does not exist`.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: `openApiControllers.js` — `h.purok_id` in Live Household SELECT

**File:** `server/src/controllers/openApiControllers.js` (line 84)

```sql
SELECT h.id, h.house_number, h.street, h.purok_id, h.barangay_id, ...
FROM households h
```

Active API endpoint. `h.purok_id` column does not exist in v2 `households` table. Any call to the Open API households endpoint returns a PostgreSQL error.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-1: `main-db.sql` Contains Full v1 Schema with `puroks` Table DDL

**File:** `barangay-information-management-system-copy/main-db.sql`

This is a `pg_dump` of a live database (contains a real password hash in the dump header). It includes the full v1 schema including `CREATE TABLE puroks`, `puroks_id_seq`, `puroks_pkey`, and `households.purok_id`. This file appears to be a production database export committed to the repository.

**This file should not be in version control.** It contains a password hash. It is also a v1 schema export — any developer using it as a reference will be working from wrong schema.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: `united-database/schema.sql` — Stale Comment References `puroks`

**File:** `united-database/schema.sql` (line 14)

```sql
-- Removed: ... puroks
```

This is a comment — correctly noting puroks were removed. Not a defect; included for completeness. No live DDL for `puroks` exists in `schema.sql`. ✅

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: `united-database/migrations/01_migrate_bims.sql` — Migrates `puroks` Table

**File:** `united-database/migrations/01_migrate_bims.sql` (lines 107–122)

Migration script INSERTs into `public.puroks` and references `households.purok_id`. This migration is designed to run against the v1 → v2 transition, so referencing the old `puroks` table is expected in the migration context. However, if run on a fresh v2 database (no v1 source), it will fail — `puroks` table is not created by `schema.sql`.

**Assessment:** This is a migration file, not production code. The defect is that it assumes a v1 source database exists. Running it on v2-only (no source DB) breaks.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: `united-database/migrations/04_verify_integrity.sql` and `rollback.sql`

Both reference `puroks` in integrity checks and rollback truncation. Same assessment as MEDIUM-2 — migration-context files designed for v1→v2 transition. Not runtime code.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-4: `seed_gis.sql` — Barangay Names Contain "Purok"

**File:** `united-database/seed_gis.sql` (lines 128–132)

GIS barangay records named `'Purok A'`, `'Purok B'`, `'Purok C'`, `'Purok D1'`, `'Purok D2'` — these are actual PSGC-registered barangay names for a specific municipality in Eastern Samar. Not a code defect. The word "Purok" here is a proper geographic name in the GIS dataset, not a reference to the removed `puroks` architecture tier.

---

### 15.2 — BIMS Backend Controllers / Services

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-4: `statisticsControllers.js` — `purokId` Extracted from `req.query` and Passed to All Stat Methods (21 occurrences)

**File:** `server/src/controllers/statisticsControllers.js`

Every statistics controller method extracts `purokId` from `req.query` and passes it to the service layer:

```js
const { barangayId, purokId } = req.query;
const data = await Statistics.getAgeDemographics({ barangayId, purokId });
```

Affected methods: `getAgeDemographics`, `getGenderDemographics`, `getCivilStatusDemographics`, `getEducationAttainmentDemographics`, `getEmploymentStatusDemographics`, `getHouseholdSizeDemographics`, `getVoterDemographics`, `getSeniorCitizenDemographics`, `getIncomeDemographics`, `getMonthlyPopulationStats`, `getPopulationByClassification`, and more.

These feed directly into the `statisticsServices.js` `if (purokId)` branches that reference `h.purok_id` — the column that does not exist in v2. As long as `purokId` is `undefined` (no param sent), the branches are skipped. But the plumbing remains fully armed.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-5: `householdControllers.js` — `purokId` Extracted and Passed in 3 Controller Methods

**File:** `server/src/controllers/householdControllers.js` (lines 48, 272, 290)

`purokId` extracted from `req.query`/`req.body` and passed to service methods that use `household.queries.js` (see CRITICAL-1).

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-2: `barangayControllers.js` — `purokId` Passed to Export Service (lines 743, 805)

**File:** `server/src/controllers/barangayControllers.js`

Two export controller functions pass `req.query.purokId` to `barangayServices.js` export methods — which use `h.purok_id` in their SQL (Section 11 CRITICAL-4).

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-3: `municipalityControllers.js` — `purokId` Passed to Export Service (lines 170, 209)

Same pattern as MAJOR-2 — municipality-level export endpoints pass `purokId` to `municipalityServices.js` which has `h.purok_id` in export SQL.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-4: `petsControllers.js` — `purokId` Extracted from `req.query` (line 118, 135)

**File:** `server/src/controllers/petsControllers.js`

`purokId` is extracted and passed to `petsServices.petList()`. In `petsServices.js`, `purokId` is accepted as a parameter (line 180) but **never used** in the SQL query body — the `if (purokId)` branch was removed but the parameter slot remains. Not a crash, but dead parameter plumbing.

---

### 15.3 — BIMS Frontend

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-6: `household.queries.js` INSERT/UPDATE Submit `purok_id` → Crashes Backend

Already documented (CRITICAL-1 above). The frontend path that triggers this:

`HouseholdLocationForm.jsx` → submits `purok_id: data.purokId` → `householdUpdateService.js` (lines 23–24, 112–114, 192, 314–315) → `householdServices.js` → `household.queries.js` INSERT/UPDATE → **crash**.

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-7: `useHouseholds.js` (features) and `hooks/useHouseholds.js` — Pass `purokId` as API Filter Param

**File:** `client/src/features/household/hooks/useHouseholds.js` (lines 64–65, 70)
**File:** `client/src/hooks/useHouseholds.js` (lines 61–62, 67)

Both hooks send `purokId: filterPurok` as a query parameter on every household list fetch. The backend `householdControllers.js` extracts it and passes it to `householdServices.js` which has `WHERE h.purok_id = $N` SQL. If `filterPurok` is non-empty, it triggers a crash. Currently the filter UI is empty so the value is `undefined` — but the wiring is live.

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL-8: `hooks/useDashboardData.js` — Sends `purokId` to Statistics API

**File:** `client/src/hooks/useDashboardData.js` (lines 59, 268)

```js
if (selectedPurok) {
  params.purokId = selectedPurok;
}
...
...(selectedPurok && { purokId: selectedPurok }),
```

`DashboardPage.jsx` maintains `selectedPurok` state (line 59). If a `selectedPurok` value is ever set (e.g. from a filter that still renders), it sends `purokId` to the statistics endpoints — triggering the `if (purokId)` branch in `statisticsServices.js` which queries `h.purok_id`. Crash.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-5: `ResidentStats.jsx` — `filterPurok` Prop Accepted and Used as API Filter

**File:** `client/src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentStats.jsx` (lines 9, 31–32)

```js
filterPurok = "",
...
if (filterPurok && filterPurok !== "all") {
  params.barangayId = filterPurok;  // ← misassigned to barangayId, not purokId
}
```

`filterPurok` is accepted as a prop and repurposed as `barangayId` — likely a patch that forgot to rename the prop. Still named `filterPurok` in the interface, which is misleading.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-6: `HouseholdStats.jsx` — `filterPurok` Sends `purokId` to API

**File:** `client/src/features/household/components/HouseholdStats.jsx` (lines 9, 31–35)

```js
if (filterPurok && filterPurok !== "all") {
  params.purokId = filterPurok;   // ← still sends purokId to backend
}
```

Live API param. If `filterPurok` is set, `purokId` is sent to the household stats endpoint → backend `householdControllers.js` → `h.purok_id` SQL → crash.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-7: `HouseholdForm.jsx` — Dead `purokId` State Logic with Hardcoded Purok Names

**File:** `client/src/features/household/components/HouseholdForm.jsx` (lines 478, 1466–1470)

```js
// Resident and purok options for ReactSelect
...
purok: (() => {
  const purokId = form.watch("purokId");
  if (purokId === "1") return "Purok 1";
  if (purokId === "2") return "Purok 2";
  if (purokId === "3") return "Purok 3";
```

Live code that watches `purokId` form state and maps it to hardcoded purok name strings. Since there are no puroks, `purokId` is always empty and this always returns `undefined`. Dead path but still live code.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-8: `householdUpdateService.js` — Normalizes and Passes `purok_id`/`purokId` Through Update Payloads

**File:** `client/src/features/household/services/householdUpdateService.js` (lines 23–24, 112–114, 192, 314–315)

Actively normalizes `purok_id` → `purokId` for camelCase and includes `purokId` in numeric field list. This is part of the household update transformation pipeline — any household update passes through here and potentially sends `purokId` to the backend.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-9: `DashboardPage.jsx` — Maintains `selectedPurok` State, Passes to All Dashboard Components

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/DashboardPage.jsx` (lines 59, 68, 97, 99, 113, 115, 129, 131, 148)

`selectedPurok` is initialized and passed as a prop to every dashboard stats component. If any component sets it to a non-null value, it propagates to `useDashboardData.js` which sends `purokId` to the statistics API.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-10: `PetTable.jsx` — Renders `purok_name` Column in Table

**File:** `client/src/features/pets/components/PetTable.jsx` (lines 88–89, 126)

```js
"purok_name",
user?.target_type === "barangay" ? "Purok" : "Barangay"
...
pet.purok_name || "No Purok"
```

Active table column. Shows "Purok" header for barangay role and renders `pet.purok_name` per row. Data will always be missing/empty since pets are joined to residents → barangays, not puroks. Every pet row shows "No Purok".

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-11: `usePets.js` — Fetches `GET /list/{id}/purok` on Mount, Passes `purokId` Filter

**File:** `client/src/features/pets/hooks/usePets.js` (lines 14–15, 37–49, 82–85)

Maintains `filterPurok` state, fetches puroks from API on mount, passes `purokId` query param when filter is set. Same crash-risk pattern as households.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-12: `ResidentsPage.jsx` — Live `GET /list/{id}/purok` on Mount, `purokId` in Every List Fetch

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/ResidentsPage.jsx` (lines 134–135, 308–316, 342–347, 378)

Maintains `filterPurok` + `puroks` state. Fetches puroks endpoint on mount. Sends `purokId` param on every resident list request when filter is set.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-13: `ResidentsFilters.jsx` — `filterPurok`/`setFilterPurok` Props Still in Component Interface

**File:** `client/src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentsFilters.jsx` (lines 15–16, 95, 97)

Props accepted and wired to a location options dropdown. If the dropdown renders a purok option and a user selects it, `filterPurok` is set and the crash chain begins.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR-14: `HouseholdsFilters.jsx` — Same Pattern as `ResidentsFilters.jsx`

**File:** `client/src/features/household/components/HouseholdsFilters.jsx` (lines 10–11, 76, 78)

Same structure — `filterPurok`/`setFilterPurok` props in interface, wired to filter dropdown.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-1: `AddResidentDialog.jsx` — `purok_id → purokId` Field Mapping Still Present

**File:** `client/src/features/barangay/residents/AddResidentDialog.jsx` (line 141)

```js
purok_id: "purokId",
```

A field name mapping from snake_case to camelCase for a field that no longer exists. Dead mapping.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-2: `ResidentViewDialog.jsx` — `puroks` Prop in Component Signature

**File:** `client/src/features/barangay/residents/components/ResidentViewDialog.jsx` (line 99)

`puroks` accepted as prop. Unused beyond this line (already confirmed in previous audit). Stale interface.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-3: `dashboardUtils.js` — `selectedPurok` and `puroks` in `getFilterDescription()`

**File:** `client/src/utils/dashboardUtils.js` (lines 146, 148, 159–162)

```js
if (selectedPurok) {
  const purok = puroks.find((p) => p.purok_id.toString() === selectedPurok);
  description += ` - ${purok.purok_name}`;
}
```

Live utility function. If `selectedPurok` is non-null and `puroks` array is empty, `purok` is `undefined` → `purok.purok_name` throws `Cannot read properties of undefined`. Runtime error if this code path is ever triggered.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-4: `householdSchema.jsx` — `purokId: z.string().optional()` in Global Zod Schema

**File:** `client/src/utils/householdSchema.jsx` (line 6)

Field still declared in the global household Zod validation schema. Harmless since it's `.optional()`, but any form using this schema still technically accepts and validates `purokId`.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-5: `Sidebar.jsx` — "Manage purok divisions" Tooltip Still Present

**File:** `client/src/components/layouts/Sidebar.jsx` (line 332)

```js
{item.title === "Puroks" && "Manage purok divisions"}
```

Tooltip text rendered when a sidebar item titled "Puroks" is shown. The Puroks route is removed from the active router, but this text lives in the sidebar component. If the Puroks nav item is ever re-added (e.g. during a regression), this description is wrong and misleading.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-6: `SettingsPage.jsx` — References Puroks in Data Export Description

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/SettingsPage.jsx` (line 1667)

```
• Puroks: Purok subdivisions and leaders
```

Shown in a data export/backup description section. Tells admins their export includes purok data — it does not.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-7: `GuidePage.jsx` — Dashboard Tips Reference Purok Filtering

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/shared/GuidePage.jsx` (lines 68, 199)

```
"Filter data by barangay and purok"
"Filter data by purok areas"
```

In-app guide still advertises purok filtering as a feature. The filter doesn't exist. Users who follow this guidance will find no such option.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-8: `RequestsPage.jsx` — `purok_name` in Address Formatting (3 occurrences)

**File:** `client/src/pages/admin/barangay/RequestsPage.jsx` (lines 379, 1286, 2693, 2857)

`request.resident_info.purok_name` used in address string construction. Will always be empty/undefined. Not a crash (uses `|| ""` fallback), but produces malformed address strings.

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM-9: `DeveloperPortal.jsx` — `purok_id: 0` in Sample API Payload

**File:** `client/src/pages/public/DeveloperPortal.jsx` (line 49)

Example household API payload shown to developers includes `"purok_id": 0`. Developers referencing this will build integrations that send `purok_id` — which will crash against v2.

---

### 15.4 — Puroks Feature Directory — Fully Intact

**Directory:** `client/src/features/barangay/puroks/components/`

All 4 files contain live, functional code:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `AddPurokDialog.jsx` | Full form modal — POST to purok API |
| `EditPurokDialog.jsx` | Full edit form — uses `purok.purok_name` |
| `DeleteConfirmationDialog.jsx` | Delete confirmation — renders `purok?.purok_name` |
| `index.js` | Barrel export of all 3 dialogs |

`PuroksPage.jsx` also still exists at `client/src/pages/admin/barangay/PuroksPage.jsx` — imports and uses all 3 dialogs from the feature directory. The page is not registered in the active router (commented out in `App.jsx`) but the code is completely functional and re-activatable with a single line.
